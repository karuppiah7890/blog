      <description>Recently me and a friend were trying to debug a stackoverflow error in helm. We used a lot of print statements in the code and were reading the code and seeing the flow and checking where it just blew up. At some point I realized we were putting lot of print statements and it was just becoming tedious to follow along the big code - it was some parsing code 😓 to parse the command line values.</description>

      <description>Recently Helm 3 alpha version was released https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.1 🎉. There are lot of new things in this release, I wanted to write about one of these things - Pushing Charts to OCI Registries!
With helm 3, you can push your charts to container registries similar to pushing container images! TLDR; Show me your terminal!
 The commands being used in the video:
$ docker run -dp 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry $ helm create my-chart $ ls $ helm chart save my-chart localhost:5000/my-chart:0.</description>

      <description>I think the first time I heard the term &amp;ldquo;Open Source&amp;rdquo; was when we were taught about different kinds of software in 12th grade. I still remember how we had so many defintions to remember, for terms like - proprietary, freeware, shareware, open source software. I&#39;m able to recall only these terms. Also, the definitions had some similarities and I also remember getting confused about the differences and similarities between the terms.</description>
