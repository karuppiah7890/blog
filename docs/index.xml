      <description>Recently the PostgreSQL community released PostgreSQL v15, which is the latest version as of this writing. I thought I could try out and experiment with the latest and greatest of PostgreSQL so I got my hands on this version with some basic steps
# Get prebuilt binary links from a trusted source. For example https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries wget https://sbp.enterprisedb.com/getfile.jsp?fileid=1258215 -O pg-15-osx-binaries.zip unzip pg-15-osx-binaries.zip sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine pgsql ./pgsql/bin/postgres --version ./pgsql/bin/psql --version .</description>

      <description>A colleague, Madhav Jivrajani, recently posted about the debug/buildinfo standard library package in Golang in my company slack channel
https://pkg.go.dev/debug/buildinfo
It is a package present from golang 1.18beta1 version
So I figured I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a try than defer it for later ;)
I got the beta version using gvm
gvm list-all -u gvm install 1.18beta1 gvm set 1.18beta1 go version Then I used VS Code editor to start off a small demo project to try out the debug/buildinfo package.</description>

      <description>I think this is very intuitive and straight forward topic. Pretty cliche too. But I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to talk about it nevertheless
There are so many technical articles on the Internet. Lot of technical content. Many of them also include code. I have seen different websites display code in many different ways. In my blog, the code display is very very basic actually 🙈 But I have high expectations from other people now 🙈 Let&amp;rsquo;s go over them!</description>

      <description>I love the current era of software for some reasons. It&amp;rsquo;s making lives easier at times. For example - there&amp;rsquo;s tons of tooling out there to help with a lot of things
People writing new products and software and tech are also considering things like upgradability, maintenance, migration etc
For example, if you are migrating a software from one major version (semantic versioning) to another major version, and also doing cool crazy stuff like doing skip upgrades like v3.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t reviewed so many Pull Requests (PRs) to be writing about them. But reading some of the reviews for my PRs and also others PRs and also having done a handful, I have come to realize a few simple things for reviewing PRs. So let&amp;rsquo;s get right into and see what they are! :)
First off, I want to call out that every tip / advice / &amp;ldquo;best practice&amp;rdquo; / idea is based on a particular context.</description>

      <description>Recently I have been trying to learn things on my own - as in, not following the formal education path - which is to pay for a online course and attend it
But in the journey I noticed quite some free online structured courses and also other ways to learn things, all for free. Paying for learning something is something I consider a bit overrated, but yeah, I do agree that there are quite some good paid content online and offline - paid online courses, paid offline courses, paid online and offline books etc</description>

      <description>In this time machine series blog post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to go back in time and recall an interesting problem we faced. We faced many interesting problems actually. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to cover each one of them in a time machine series blog post :D For now I&amp;rsquo;m just noting down all the bits and pieces in my notes based on whatever I can recall!
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s checkout what problem we faced with respect to database connections!</description>

      <description>In this time machine series I want to recall some of my older experiences that I didn&amp;rsquo;t write blog posts about. It&amp;rsquo;s basically me going back in time and recalling some of the cool things that my team did
Migration of components In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;m gonna tell about one of the stories from my work from around 2019 end / 2020 start if I remember correctly
Me and my team had this task of migrating a lot of components - Postgres databases and Redis databases / caches from one Kubernetes cluster to multiple clusters</description>

      <description>This is a very simple post about the kind of features that users would expect in general when it comes to the ability to share URLs of websites
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with an example. I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of us would have shared a lot of URLs. A popular example that comes to my mind is - sharing YouTube videos. YouTube allows users to share videos by having a button called &amp;ldquo;Share&amp;rdquo;, which shows the video&amp;rsquo;s short URL link and also the ability to share the URL on different mediums with ease.</description>

      <description>This is a short post about how one can try to avoid rookie mistakes. This is just me jotting down lessons for myself :)
Note: Rookie mistakes are common and can happen anytime. It&amp;rsquo;s good to learn from them and create processes and tools that help you succeed :)
Recently I made a rookie mistake where I created a temporary git branch in a git repository, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t delete it and this lead to problematic things that I won&amp;rsquo;t get into</description>

      <description>This post is to see some of the cool things in the modern software development and the kind of experience that developers can get. This post especially focuses on a kind of experience that I expect to get as a developer when I develop for backend (servers, services, microservices etc) or frontend (web app). I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be focusing on other kind of software in this blog post

      <guid>https://karuppiah7890.github.io/blog/posts/linting-shell-scripts-using-shellcheck-tool/</guid>
      <description>TLDR; shellcheck is a open source linter for your shell (sh/bash/dash/ksh) scripts! The official website calls it as - &amp;ldquo;a static analysis tool for shell scripts&amp;rdquo;. A small example usage -
$ cat list-special-files.sh #!/bin/bash dir=$1 for file in &amp;#34;$dir/special-*&amp;#34;; do echo $file done $ shellcheck list-special-files.sh In list-special-files.sh line 5: for file in &amp;#34;$dir/special-*&amp;#34;; do ^--------------^ SC2066: Since you double quoted this, it will not word split, and the loop will only run once.</description>

      <description>⚠️ This is kind of a rant post too. You have been warned! 😅 Also, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of scattered thoughts too. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry if you feel lost somewhere 🙈
Given that a lot of modern and tech based companies have moved from an office setup to a remote working setup - working out of homes or multiple scattered very small offices etc, the mindset of the companies doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have changed much.</description>

      <description>I have been working with software since 2011 when I started learning the ABCs of C/C++ in my 11th grade, and I was a user of software way before that. I have been professionally working with software since 2017 when I started freelancing and then joined my first company for a full time job
If I look back at all those years of writing code, I can clearly remember some experiences where I banged my head to solve some problem and figured out a good way to debug or analyze the problem at the end of it.</description>

      <description>I was recently working on a front end project where the code was written in TypeScript. It was a React project, and it was bootstrapped with Create React App (CRA) tool. And the testing framework that we used was Jest.
The team quickly realized that the test code we wrote was not being type checked and we could see TypeScript type errors in our text editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) but there were no such type errors when running the tests using react-scripts tool to run the tests which in turn used Jest</description>

This post is to provoke some thoughts in people

      <description>Do you know how email tracking works? In this blog post we will look at some of the basics of email tracking.
A few years ago, I was working on this open source software called Mail for Good by Freecodecamp.
https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/mail-for-good
It was a software used by Freecodecamp and many NGOs for their email campaign management. It was built on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Email Service (SES) which costed around $1 for 10,000 emails at that time.</description>

I know better about what happened after I joined, but given my bad memory, I can only recall some of the important moments. Also, it was around a 2 year journey. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to recall as much as possible 😅</description>

      <guid>https://karuppiah7890.github.io/blog/posts/how-ci-cd-systems-work-with-source-code-hosting-services/</guid>
      <description>I have always been curious about internals of some systems, if not all. One of them is the CI/CD system and how it works with source code hosting services. Apparently it&amp;rsquo;s not too complicated. So, let&amp;rsquo;s dive and see what are the different ways CI/CD systems work with source code hosting services
So, what&amp;rsquo;s actually the thing that I was curious about? I was to curious to understand how a CI/CD pipeline runs for exactly a given commit especially when there are pushes to the source code immediately in a matter of a few moments / seconds, but pipeline for both runs only after a few moments but at the same time but with correct commit in each.</description>

      <description>Based on some recent experience, I have noticed how one can easily store secrets in plain text files and things could go very wrong.
First off, some people store secrets in plain text files in their git repositories by mistake
Only for example purposes, below are some links
https://github.com/UnravelAI/unravel-api/commit/c0599c4d798c8333b8a1c643d1e02dbec4a7cc1d
https://github.com/steppingcloudlabs/single-tenant-alumniportal/commit/f99e126fd1d8e486ac81e2e3d77aa14424ad525f
I just had to do a GitHub search
https://github.com/search?q=aws+credentials+env&amp;amp;type=commits
And I found the above. Fortunately the people who removed the keys from their git repository knew that the git history would contain it and hence revoked the keys and rotated it to get new keys.</description>

      <description>A lot of times it good to have a lot of access in the systems we interact with. This could be any system - external systems or internal systems. For example, git / source code repository access is a pretty common thing. Let&amp;rsquo;s say your team has a private repository on GitHub. You can have any kind of access to this repository - read access, write access, or even admin access, for example to change settings and what not.</description>

      <description>In our world, money is something that has become essential to buy things and live life.
A lot of us work for hours and hours every day, every week. We get paid very little or maybe a lot.
And then after this, many of us don&amp;rsquo;t think much about money. Very few people talk about savings, investments, money.
Everyone&amp;rsquo;s talking about physical fitness and physical health, mental health, career stuff. I have rarely seen people talk about money.</description>

      <description>If you have not heard of Hashicorp Consul before, then this bytes (short) post is going to be interesting!
Consul is an interesting software that has a lot of features, which is a boon and a bane I guess. One of the features it has is - it has a Key Value (KV) store
A Key Value (KV) store is a kind of data storage software that helps you store data in the form of key value pairs.</description>

      <description>Note that this is completely based on my experience and research from a user perspective, having used some open source for a cost and seen cost for open source software
Open source and money is an interesting topic. Many who are new to open source might wonder what&amp;rsquo;s powering open source software. It is true that many open source projects, especially the small ones, probably are written and maintained by one person or a few people, at no cost.</description>

      <description>MailCatcher is a nice little tool to help you run a dummy email server
It&amp;rsquo;s open source - https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher
Why would one use it? There are two use cases for which I personally used it for.
One is - trying out a program in local which needs an email server as part of setup. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t setup an email server like the ones people do in production environments or use email services like AWS Simple Email Service, as I was only simply trying out the program and not doing a production deployment.</description>

      <description>TLDR Assertions in programming generally have &amp;ldquo;expected&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;actual&amp;rdquo; value to check if the &amp;ldquo;actual&amp;rdquo; value is equal to the &amp;ldquo;expected&amp;rdquo; value. When the programmer provides the two values in the wrong order to the assertion library then when errors occur, they are confusing to read. Getting the order of &amp;ldquo;expected&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;actual&amp;rdquo; value can be helpful to get a sensible error message which one can read and understand the issue when errors occur in assertion.</description>

      <description>All the code for this blog post is present in the demo GitLab repo.
It has GitLab CI Config and also a demo pipeline which shows how it runs.
Recently I wrote a blog post about integration tests and some ways to do it. One of the ways talks about using GitLab CI/CD&amp;rsquo;s Services feature. I realized it deserves a separate blog post, so here it is :D
This blog post is meant to create awareness around this feature of GitLab CI/CD and also give a basic introduction.</description>

      <description>Today I learned a new thing when someone asked something -
&amp;ldquo;We have two services in docker compose file. How to run one service optionally based on some feature toggle like environment variable or command line option? Is it possible to do this in a single Docker Compose file?&amp;rdquo;
TLDR One way is to control the replica count. If replica count is 0, then it means no instance of the service is running.</description>

      <description>Testcontainers is a library that helps you run Docker containers to run components for your integration tests. There&amp;rsquo;s a Java library and there are libraries in other languages too.
I wrote a part 1 blog post about integration tests and an introduction to Testcontainers. It didn&amp;rsquo;t have any code examples though.
A lot of the docs on the websites are really good for you to get started. I&amp;rsquo;m still writing this and upcoming posts to give a bit more details based on the experience from using Testcontainers in our project.</description>

      <description>Note: This post does not cover code examples for Testcontainers. That will be part of part 2.
TLDR Sometimes you have some external components in your system - like a data store or cache or message queue and similar. Some examples of external components are - Postgres, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ.
You might be writing and running integration tests against actual components to ensure the integration works. To run these actual components - you could do it in many ways.</description>

      <description>Note: This article assumes you know about Kubernetes basics like Pods and that Pods run on nodes, and that Kubernetes works in a cluster architecture with usually more than one node.
TLDR; DaemonSet is a specific name of a resource in Kubernetes in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it. I like to call it as &amp;ldquo;run everywhere thing&amp;rdquo; when I introduce it to newbies. If you need to run a program / software in every node of the Kubernetes cluster, then this article might be of interest to you.</description>

If you want to take it up to the next level, use automated tools to detect some kinds of dead code to make your lives more easier ;) Use the same automated tools to fail Continuous Integration pipelines when dead code is detected.</description>

      <description>In my current project, we work with Spring Boot. Recently, I was writing a Data Transfer Object (DTO) and we also had to add validations to the fields. Usually, while doing this, we also add tests to ensure that in the future we don&amp;rsquo;t remove or change the validations by mistake and instead it&amp;rsquo;s more intentional as we have to also change the tests.

Photo by Lewis Keegan - Skillscouter.com on Unsplash May be you could say that&amp;rsquo;s true, but only if it&amp;rsquo;s layman slang. Officially, in computer science, the concept of digital signature has a different meaning.
It does denote someone&amp;rsquo;s or some entity&amp;rsquo;s signature, in a digital world. Yes. So, that&amp;rsquo;s not wrong.</description>

To start off, I work on a React project with Typescript. We need to ensure we follow some good practices as much as possible, so we use ESLint in our project We also use Prettier for formatting, so that our code looks neat and the same always no matter who worked on it, letting us read code in a consistent manner and not fight about formatting rules.</description>

      <description>Role Based Access Control, also known as RBAC is method to provide / restrict access to users in a software system. It&amp;rsquo;s something that comes up in the topic of Authorization.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already heard about Authentication and Authorization, it&amp;rsquo;s worth to check out both of them. The one liner is, Authentication is all about identifying the user, it answers the question &amp;ldquo;hey user, who are you? identify yourselves, and prove me who you tell you are.</description>

I kind of knew that my implementation would involve Keycloak, a software we use for Authentication and Authorization feature in our app. But little did I realize that I would have to also work with CSS to customize the theme of our login page, instead of using the default theme of the super cool Keycloak default login page.</description>

So, in this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about One Time Passwords (OTPs) and going to try to take a crack at how it is probably implemented behind the scenes.</description>

      <description>For me, usually the fastest way to getting started with any big software - server side software, with other components (backend, proxy etc) is using docker and/ docker-compose.
Keycloak&amp;rsquo;s basic setup would be a Keycloak server with a database. It supports many databases actually.
The quickest way to get started with Keycloak would be to run Keycloak with H2 database, like this using docker
$ docker run -d --name keycloak -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin jboss/keycloak It will take a few seconds or a minute to bootup.</description>

      <description>In my current project, there was a decision made to use Keycloak for Identity and Access Management (IAM). People said that &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to write code to do authentication and authorization and reinvent the wheel, it&amp;rsquo;s already done by a lot of people. Keycloak is just really good, it just works, use it&amp;rdquo;.
Now, I am pretty new to almost every technology in the project. So I&amp;rsquo;m still learning a lot of things.</description>

      <description>Really? I understand it&amp;rsquo;s a less used feature. I have not seen many people talk about it or use it, but hey, it&amp;rsquo;s an important security feature - as anyone can masquerade as someone else! I mean, ideally it won&amp;rsquo;t happen, in a company or organization where everyone is trusted. It&amp;rsquo;s still a good thing. Also, if some open source community is using it, it&amp;rsquo;s still good. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s the deal, but BitBucket Cloud doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Git commit signing as of this writing</description>

      <description>I recently found out about the She Loves Data (SLD) community through my amazing company. Apparently quite a few colleagues of mine are volunteering and helping the SLD community. There was this Introduction to Python workshop by SLD and I found out that they are looking for volunteers as there were a lot of registrations. I was encouraging some of my friends to volunteer and mentor in the workshop to help participants.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m not some genius. The below are just my thoughts / opinions based on experience. I&amp;rsquo;m not basing it off of any facts really.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be pretty straight forward on this. We live in a very crazy competitive world. Almost everything seems to be a race. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be in it, you are kind of in it, or at least affected by it. Atleast that&amp;rsquo;s my opinion.</description>

https://github.com/GOVINDDIXIT
Govind&amp;rsquo;s profile looked so cool! Below is a screenshot of the same
That&amp;rsquo;s just a part of it! There was a lot of information in the profile. After seeing this, I was searching on the Internet to find some docs on how to do this. Weirdly I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any official GitHub docs on how to add readme to a user profile.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much now, but I&amp;rsquo;m gonna try to recall as much as possible. So, I was young, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember at what age this happened. Surely some age after I was 11 or 12 as that&amp;rsquo;s what I got my new computer and Internet. And I think at that time Orkut was pretty famous. So a bit later than that when Facebook was famous in India. So, I saw something about a different theme for Facebook.</description>

      <description>This was during college. I was trying to learn hacking. Haha. I remember following this series of blog posts, which explained stuff. I even printed them out to read and understand and learn. These were big blog posts. The first few posts they mostly taught about networking, this is because, to hack someone, remotely, you need to access their system remotely, and remotely means there must be some connection to the system, and that&amp;rsquo;s where networks and network concepts came in.</description>

      <description>Recently I was writing this code for a JSON REST API. We were adding an extra field to our API structure, for a resource. For the sake of simplicity let&amp;rsquo;s assume we were building an API to store rich text in our database. The size of this rich text was small, like 500 characters, that&amp;rsquo;s it. And let&amp;rsquo;s say we came up with some simple solutions on how to store the rich text.</description>

      <description>A software is more than just source code. This is true for anything. Any creation. The creation may be defined by people in just a few words, the reality is, there are always people behind the creation. There&amp;rsquo;s always a people aspect to things. In Software, this means everyone involved with the software - all of the teams of developers, product managers, quality analysts, project managers, and Every other than Role who helped build the software and is part of the company behind the software.</description>

      <description>Many front end javascript files are bundled into one file usually, and all the spaces removed, all function and variable names changed - minified. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what else they do as part of &amp;ldquo;minification&amp;rdquo; process and bundling process. Finally you get that obscure JavaScript file. This also reduces the size of the file and hence the amount of data to be downloaded, which makes a big difference, especially for people with low network bandwidth or bad Internet.</description>

      <description>I was randomly thinking about JSON, jq tool and the tool&amp;rsquo;s ability to prettify JSON by indenting with spaces and it&amp;rsquo;s ability to remove spaces too.
Suddenly for a second I was thinking why HTTP responses should not have spaces? If they had spaces they would look so cool right? 😂
In a moment I got the answer - yeah. You got it right. Prettifying the JSON with indentation will mean - add spaces.</description>

Started off to write a poem. It turned out to be something else. :P
The Pot Everyone&amp;rsquo;s born with a pot.
A very special kind of pot,
which is very much connected
to you and has life in it.
When you are young,
it&amp;rsquo;s soft and big.
And it&amp;rsquo;s prone to breaking.
And breaks most times.
People always break it.</description>

      <description>I was walking with my friends on the road. Suddenly I smelled a rose from the other side of the river. I didn&amp;rsquo;t inform my friends and sneaked out and left them to go in the opposite side towards the river.
The water was flowing happily fast. It was so hard for me to cross the river, but I crossed it. I ran towards the smell of the rose. I could finally see it from far away with lot of thorns around it.</description>

I finally reach her. She hands the basket and gives me some shillings and then some extra and says &amp;ldquo;Just make sure it goes away.</description>

And the search sometimes takes time - almost the same amount of time that took for me during the first time.</description>

Since then and up until now, I have seen multiple instances where I can clearly say everything is about people, including code. I mean, I guess we have made ourselves the centre of the Earth 😅 If we should be inclusive, I think the phrasing should be - everything is about living organisms. For this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll limit myself to talking about just code.</description>

In terms of Open Source, it has happened quite a lot of times for me I think. I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on a Pull Request to fix an issue. I&amp;rsquo;ll take an approach and then maintainers feel that the approach can be changed totally.</description>

      <description>I have created dummy files two times or so now. Now, what do I mean when I say a dummy file? In my case, I mean a file which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any actual content, instead it has more like some random dummy data. Similar to the lorem ipsum content that people use for placeholder text during development when they don&amp;rsquo;t have actual content ready yet
Before telling the reasons for why I needed a dummy file, I&amp;rsquo;ll first tell how I created a dummy file.</description>

      <description>I usually use IntelliJ when I&amp;rsquo;m working on company projects. These days I have been trying to use VS Code. Recently I have realized that VS Code&amp;rsquo;s Golang extension has a lot of new features to offer. I think a lot of credit goes to gopls (&amp;ldquo;go please&amp;rdquo;) - https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls . I have been using VS Code with repos that have go modules (without vendoring). With vendoring on and go v1.</description>

      <description>Like, really, don&amp;rsquo;t you think no code is awesome? Kelsey Hightower created this repo - https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode where he says there&amp;rsquo;s no code, nothing to deploy, and that it is the best way to write secure and reliable applications
Wow right? :P I mean, if you are a software engineer, and you get paid for writing no code, that would be awesome right? 😂🤣 Well, not gonna happen I guess. You Will write code.</description>

      <description>I have contributed to a few open source repositories. One good thing I learned is - tests are very important and that we need to make sure that the software is robust. And when software breaks, it means that some test for a scenario is missing - add it, and the test will fail, as there&amp;rsquo;s a bug and then it can be fixed. Now, that&amp;rsquo;s a fix being done after the bug has been discovered.</description>

      <description>This post is about how I spin up VMs in my local machine. This is considering I have already chosen to run something in a VM and not in a container like Docker container or any other tech like unikernels and others that I don&amp;rsquo;t know about :p
Now, back to VMs. Now, usually I used to use Virtual Box to run VMs in my local. It&amp;rsquo;s open source and I can run it in my Mac.</description>

      <description>I consider myself a bit forgetful. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to tell the reasons for that, but I think I know some reasons 🤔 anyways, now, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can solve the problem and remember more things. And even if I do, it will take time and till then, I need some mechanism to help me remember things. So, what do I do? Other than my brain, what can store lots of information and not forget it very easily?</description>

      <description>So today I was planning to travel in a van to a metro station and then in metro, go to the metro station near my house and then walk to my house which is close by
Unfortunately my van didn&amp;rsquo;t come. I then walked to a bus station and got a bus to the metro station. Now I had to pay, in cash for the bus fare. And I realized that I might not have cash in my wallet.</description>

$ # exec into a pod in the default namespace $ execpod $ # exec into a pod in a particular namespace $ execpod -n &amp;lt;namespace-name&amp;gt; $ # exec into a pod in any namespace by seeing all namespace pods $ execpod -a Or if you don&amp;rsquo;t have kube-fzf, you can use the below</description>

Anything that happened with respect to Open Source for me. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write as much stories as possible! Not all of them will have technical stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s a story :P It could have anything. So, today I have one story to tell ;)</description>

      <description>Have you ever tried to record your terminal? Or seen anyone&amp;rsquo;s recording of their terminal? Usually people record to show how a tool works and put it in the tool&amp;rsquo;s README in the git repo. You can also record to do tutorial videos and more :)
So, my first thought to record my terminal would have been to just record my screen or terminal window using some screen recording / screen capture tool like Kap.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: These are just my thoughts. Or rants. :P
Every day I code. I face problems. Usually I get immersed in the problem. These days I try to be lazy. I try. I think of how to go past the problem, get rid of it, not face it in the future, make my life easier.
I also don&amp;rsquo;t like to sit idle, waiting for my tests and build. I have a macbook pro 2017 version and even that&amp;rsquo;s not enough sometimes 🙈 we really need to work on better software folks.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve planned to run a bit. To practice for a marathon - 5km one. I have run crazily once for 7.5 km. Almost killed myself in the process 😂
Yesterday I ran okay. I ran twice yesterday. Both times quite slowly, atleast that&amp;rsquo;s what I believe. It looked like I was running very slowly. But you should have seen the amount of energy that I was spending to do that.</description>

      <description>Have you ever done remote pair programming over the Internet? Or tried to share your screen over the Internet to show someone something on your screen? Using slack, team viewer, zoom, and what not. How was the experience?
Being a programmer, I&amp;rsquo;m sure a lot of you spend your time in the terminal, editor / IDE and the browser? And probably more! Like slack :P
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s say, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use slack / zoom to just do audio call over the Internet, or use something like Google Meet or even just a phone call using my mobile network or over the Internet using WhatsApp</description>

      <description>So, today I found something funny and interesting. Someone in our slack #tech-reads channel shared a tech read by antirez, the creator of redis software. This is the link that they shared -
http://antirez.com/news/123
I immediately tried out the command in my terminal and it was cool! See the recording here -
The commands used in the recording are below
$ redis-cli 127.0.0.1:6379&amp;gt; lolwut 127.0.0.1:6379&amp;gt; lolwut 10 1 4 127.0.0.1:6379&amp;gt; lolwut 1 1 4 127.</description>

      <description>Long ago, in one post I wrote about how to debug Go program in Intellij IDEA / Goland. I realized not everyone uses IDEA ecosystem though, as they are paid. You could check out the IDEA community edition though, which is free. And you can install the Go plugin from here. In my case I used to use IDEA Ultimate and evaluate it (Evaluator version) for free, now I use a company license.</description>

He knew that I have been cycling a bit recently. He asked if I wanted to come. I said okay and started planning for this event
The theme being &amp;ldquo;pedal to fight cancer&amp;rdquo;. The fund from the event would go to Cancer children at Adyar Cancer Institute in Chennai, where I live
The first thought was - it&amp;rsquo;s too early 😂 But I just registered.</description>

Two things that I have tried recently - sandwiches and omelette wraps. 😂 This is my own recipe - so my version of how I made the food, and how I named it too 😛
Sandwich Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the sandwich
I got some veggies first - cucumber, carrot, tomato and some sprouts. I decided the sprouts will be like a side dish.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been cycling for about two weeks now
I use the smart bike app to get a rented cycle and I got a helmet for my saftey and I drive almost everyday in the morning and sometimes I have ridden in the evening too during weekends
So, why and how did I start doing this?
I think the first inspiration for me is my friend Nimalan. Who started cycling and putting posts about his trips and more.</description>

We are in a grade 10 class in AllCool School. Students are studying chemistry and their professor has asked them to solve a problem
Aman has finished the problem and he is acting as though he&amp;rsquo;s not done and is pretending he&amp;rsquo;s thinking about the problem and is looking around to pretend he wants help. While looking around he is thinking &amp;ldquo;Damn, I wish I could keep looking at Rahul.</description>

We used a lot of print statements in the code and were reading the code and seeing the flow and checking where it just blew up. At some point I realized we were putting lot of print statements and it was just becoming tedious to follow along the big code - it was some parsing code 😓 to parse the command line values.</description>

With helm 3, you can push your charts to container registries similar to pushing container images! TLDR; Show me your terminal!
The commands being used in the video:
$ docker run -dp 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry $ helm create my-chart $ ls $ helm chart save my-chart localhost:5000/my-chart:0.</description>

      <description>I think the first time I heard the term &amp;ldquo;Open Source&amp;rdquo; was when we were taught about different kinds of software in 12th grade. I still remember how we had so many defintions to remember, for terms like - proprietary, freeware, shareware, open source software. I&amp;rsquo;m able to recall only these terms. Also, the definitions had some similarities and I also remember getting confused about the differences and similarities between the terms.</description>
