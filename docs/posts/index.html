      If you don&rsquo;t know what a digital signature is, in layman terms you may think of this, a photo of your physical signature
Photo by Lewis Keegan - Skillscouter.com on Unsplash May be you could say that&rsquo;s true, but only if it&rsquo;s layman slang. Officially, in computer science, the concept of digital signature has a different meaning.
It does denote someone&rsquo;s or some entity&rsquo;s signature, in a digital world. Yes. So, that&rsquo;s not wrong.

        lint-staged: Lint Your Staged Files
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In my project, we use this tool called lint-staged which is pretty awesome! I wanted to write this blog post to talk a little bit about it and also mention some of the cool things I liked about it! :D
To start off, I work on a React project with Typescript. We need to ensure we follow some good practices as much as possible, so we use ESLint in our project We also use Prettier for formatting, so that our code looks neat and the same always no matter who worked on it, letting us read code in a consistent manner and not fight about formatting rules.

        Role Based Access Control

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Role Based Access Control, also known as RBAC is method to provide / restrict access to users in a software system. It&rsquo;s something that comes up in the topic of Authorization.
If you haven&rsquo;t already heard about Authentication and Authorization, it&rsquo;s worth to check out both of them. The one liner is, Authentication is all about identifying the user, it answers the question &ldquo;hey user, who are you? identify yourselves, and prove me who you tell you are.

      TLDR;  Be aware of the benefits of HTTPS. Always try to use HTTPS when using a website Always try to use HTTPS when building / developing a website, even if your site does not get any sensitive or confidential input from the user at all, or store or serve any user data.  Longer version If you have not heard of HTTPS before but have heard of HTTP, I would recommend reading about it.

      TLDR; Record your demos and use recording to show the demo. Or at least use the recording as a backup, in case the actual demo goes wrong.
Longer version Have you ever had to do a demo to an audience? Say in a workshop to teach something, or in a talk / learning session, or to show your colleagues something cool, or just to your clients or customers in a professional setup.

      Recently, when I was online on LinkedIn, I noticed this simple post which said something along the lines of &ldquo;In a world of Byjus and White Hat Jr, be someone&rsquo;s Khan Academy and Code.org&rdquo;
I think people within India might be able to relate to some parts of it. The post is related to paid coding courses. You must have seen the tons of comments on the post - many criticizing the companies behind these paid coding courses.

      I&rsquo;m going to be 25 this December. Having lived only around 25 years on this planet, I may have less experience compared to you, also adding to the fact that I consider myself very very ignorant when it comes to the matters of the world or as one calls it &ldquo;current affairs&rdquo; and &ldquo;general knowledge&rdquo;. Given this background about myself, I would like to have a take on the topic of &ldquo;Beauty&rdquo; in this post, probably a sensitive / controversial topic, but I&rsquo;m okay with that.

      I have conducted very few public events and lots of internal (company) events related to knowledge sharing in tech space. In this post I want to talk about barriers for participants to attending public events.
Let&rsquo;s start with in-person events. I&rsquo;ll take an example of a knowledge sharing event which is open for everyone and free too. Usually such events need some space for people come together, relax and sit, to listen to the speaker share their learnings.

        Learning CSS: A bumpy journey

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Recently I took up the task of implementing the login feature of our application. I took it up knowing I know nothing, so that I&rsquo;ll learn it and do it and come out of it learning something new and with some knowledge on how things work.
I kind of knew that my implementation would involve Keycloak, a software we use for Authentication and Authorization feature in our app. But little did I realize that I would have to also work with CSS to customize the theme of our login page, instead of using the default theme of the super cool Keycloak default login page.
