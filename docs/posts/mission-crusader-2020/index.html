    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>A friend of mine recently shared some posters about a cyclathon / cycle rally</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/poster-1.jpg" alt="poster-1" title="poster-1"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/poster-2.jpg" alt="poster-2" title="poster-2"></p>
<p>He knew that I have been cycling a bit recently. He asked if I wanted to come.
I said okay and started planning for this event</p>
<p>The theme being &ldquo;pedal to fight cancer&rdquo;. The fund from the event would go to
Cancer children at Adyar Cancer Institute in Chennai, where I live</p>
<p>The first thought was - it&rsquo;s too early 😂 But I just registered. They asked I needed
a cycle or if I can bring my own. I checked where the start point was, for some time,
I was thinking of going to the venue - SRM Easwari College, 11 kilometers from my house
by my rented cycle and then continue from there. Later somehow I decided to go by cab
and booked a cycle too for me while registering</p>
<p>The registration - I did it in the last minute - the registrations were closed, but since
I paid a volunteer directly and then told him about it, he said it&rsquo;s fine and that he will register
for me. Or else I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone to the event 😅</p>
<p>After registering, I got my message</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/cycle-number-message.png" alt="cycle-number-message" title="cycle-number-message"></p>
<p>The event happened today morning. Yesterday night I was in a dilemma. I thought - &ldquo;well,
I&rsquo;m going to cycle in the event, but to go to the event I go by cab? What? It&rsquo;s like going to
the gym by vehicle. It&rsquo;s better to walk or whatever, and have the gym nearby&rdquo;. Unfortunately, the
event was happening far away like I mentioned and I couldn&rsquo;t change that. Anyways, finally, today
morning I decided to go by cycle if I get one. That&rsquo;s the problem with cycles - it&rsquo;s not certain that
I&rsquo;ll get one. Usually I do. Still. So, today morning, this is what happened - I was struggling to find a good rented cycle. Previously I would just get any cycle and go on. Later I realized that if the air in the
cycle is even a bit less, then the amount of energy that I need to pedal went really high. Recently I have
been taking cycles which have really good air in both tyres - so good that they are rock hard, and then
have good brakes and good bells and seats are adjustable - sometimes it&rsquo;s too tight and hard to adjust!
Brakes - mostly it&rsquo;s good, not always, same for bells. With this criteria, I couldn&rsquo;t get a good cycle, so
I just decided to get a cab. And this was around 4 am in the morning 😂 I was roaming around to find that
good cycle. Anyways. Something to add is - I had my helmet and bottle, since I thought I would be riding to
the venue. I would have surely had my bottle in any case. Now, I got my cab and went to the place</p>
<p>I went inside the college, got my &ldquo;I1&rdquo; label which I wore on the left side of my tee shirt. And then
waited for a long time, for the event to start. I think the volunteers wanted almost everyone to come
and be ready for the event to start 😅 We did some warm up exercise and Zumba dance :P and then got our
cycles. Now, they also had helmet with the cycles. I had my own helmet and bottle too. And there was no
basket or bottle stand in the cycle. I then gave the cycle&rsquo;s helmet and my bottle to a volunteer and used
my helmet. It was a cycle with lots of gears. A cool cycle! Unfortunately it didn&rsquo;t have bells though :P I
realized it only while riding 😂</p>
<p>I got help to increase the seat height for my cycle and asked about the gears. There were gear
controls on both the left and right handle. I was like &ldquo;what is this?&quot;. Then I was told that
gear 2 or 3 on the left is good and the right is for going really fast, and something about the
chains coming out and I got super scared and decided to just use left gear control and not even
touch the right one. :P</p>
<p>So, the race started finally. Pardon the blurry pics xp</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/rally-starting-1.jpg" alt="rally-starting-1" title="rally-starting-1"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/rally-starting-2.jpg" alt="rally-starting-2" title="rally-starting-2"></p>
<p>And we were off to go for around 9 kilometers. Everyone was cycling so close. It was a bit
scary for me. Also, we started only at 6:30 am or so, when were supposed to start at 5am. I
felt that starting early is safer compared to later when more and more people wake up and
get on the road and go in high speed :P and cause traffic too</p>
<p>We were given instructions to pair up and go in pairs. But no one followed 🙈😂 But most of the
time, everyone was safe. I heard two people alone fell once. Small injuries. But no big issues.
There were first aid teams :) There were also some folks helping with road traffic management -
to help everyone cross big roads and traffic police also helped. And many volunteers went on
two wheelers and took pics and videos with Go Pros. I think they captured everyone :)</p>
<p>It was quite cool. We finally finished. And they had already said that there were no winners
or losers. And I was no where close to first 😂 But I did ride good and I rode fast at times :P
I was trying to ride in places where there were less people - less dense, unlike more dense, where
people rode the cycle very very close, which I didn&rsquo;t want to do because that&rsquo;s a safety issue -
sudden breaks, possible clashes and what not, so yeah. Some people were talking and riding very close.
Like, each person was on a different cycle, and they were riding close and talking.
I was talking too a bit in between, while riding 🙈 but only a bit and then I could see myself not
being able to cope up, so I just chucked it and moved on to ride alone. It feels good to talk to friends.
It&rsquo;s entertaining. But, I usually feel the roads are not safe for talking and riding :P especially not safe
for the folks doing it and for others too. Also, I&rsquo;m okay with people talking as long as it doesn&rsquo;t affect
others but themselves since they took that decision intentionally. But usually it affects others too.
Anything a person does on the road usually affects others too - good or bad. So, I would advice everyone to
not talk with their friend on the other vehicle while they both are riding - they both could stop their
vehicle on the side and talk. 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>Enough advice, now, back to the cycle rally :P We then took pics after finishing</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/group-pic-1.jpg" alt="group-pic-1" title="group-pic-1"></p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/group-pic-4.jpg" alt="group-pic-4" title="group-pic-4"></p>
<p>And this is the green cycle I rode -</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/cycle-1.jpg" alt="cycle-1" title="cycle-1"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/cycle-2.jpg" alt="cycle-2" title="cycle-2"></p>
<p>This is the map from strava -</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/strava-map.png" alt="strava-map" title="strava-map"></p>
<p>And then there was a post event thing. They had some vote of thanks,
some speeches - from lots of people, volunteers, event sponsors and partners.
There were refreshments, and then we got our certificates, medals, and seed balls! The crowd -</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/crowd-1.jpg" alt="crowd-1" title="crowd-1"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/crowd-2.jpg" alt="crowd-2" title="crowd-2"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/crowd-3.jpg" alt="crowd-3" title="crowd-3"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/crowd-4.jpg" alt="crowd-4" title="crowd-4"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/crowd-5.jpg" alt="crowd-5" title="crowd-5"></p>
<p>And then it was all fun ;) People were dancing and all.</p>
<p>I then gave feedback to the volunteers about the event - good stuff and the stuff to
imrpove - like timing since they started late. 😅</p>
<p>And then I got my friend to take my pics with my certificate and medal ;)</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/me-with-medal-and-cert-1.jpg" alt="me-with-medal-and-cert-1" title="me-with-medal-and-cert-1"></p>

<p>And then I started off. I booked an Uber and came back home :)</p>
<p>The certificate and medal pics -</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/cert.jpg" alt="cert" title="cert"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/medal-front.jpg" alt="medal-front" title="medal-front"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/mission-crusader-2020/medal-back.jpg" alt="medal-back" title="medal-back"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all, till next time&rsquo;s mission crusader 👋 ! Or, may be next time, I&rsquo;ll just go cycling
all by myself and donate funds separately to such institutions! :D</p>
