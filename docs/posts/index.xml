      <description>Recently I wrote about how I write for myself and mostly because I forget stuff. I think I can find more reasons to write - the more, the better. It&amp;rsquo;ll make me write more! So, I remember reading this concept of Learning in Public, but I just remembered the phrase not the whole concept later, until recently when I read this post about learning in public - and few other posts related to it</description>

      <description>Sometimes, the craziest thing for me is - the amount of effort I put into something, some work, but how I do it all wrong because I don&amp;rsquo;t know some of the expectations of the work. It&amp;rsquo;s very crazy.
In terms of Open Source, it has happened quite a lot of times for me I think. I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on a Pull Request to fix an issue. I&amp;rsquo;ll take an approach and then maintainers feel that the approach can be changed totally.</description>

      <description>I have created dummy files two times or so now. Now, what do I mean when I say a dummy file? In my case, I mean a file which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any actual content, instead it has more like some random dummy data. Similar to the lorem ipsum content that people use for placeholder text during development when they don&amp;rsquo;t have actual content ready yet
Before telling the reasons for why I needed a dummy file, I&amp;rsquo;ll first tell how I created a dummy file.</description>

      <description>I usually use IntelliJ when I&amp;rsquo;m working on company projects. These days I have been trying to use VS Code. Recently I have realized that VS Code&amp;rsquo;s Golang extension has a lot of new features to offer. I think a lot of credit goes to gopls (&amp;ldquo;go please&amp;rdquo;) - https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls . I have been using VS Code with repos that have go modules (without vendoring). With vendoring on and go v1.</description>

      <description>Like, really, don&amp;rsquo;t you think no code is awesome? Kelsey Hightower created this repo - https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode where he says there&amp;rsquo;s no code, nothing to deploy, and that it is the best way to write secure and reliable applications
Wow right? :P I mean, if you are a software engineer, and you get paid for writing no code, that would be awesome right? üòÇü§£ Well, not gonna happen I guess. You Will write code.</description>

      <description>I have contributed to a few open source repositories. One good thing I learned is - tests are very important and that we need to make sure that the software is robust. And when software breaks, it means that some test for a scenario is missing - add it, and the test will fail, as there&amp;rsquo;s a bug and then it can be fixed. Now, that&amp;rsquo;s a fix being done after the bug has been discovered.</description>

      <description>This post is about how I spin up VMs in my local machine. This is considering I have already chosen to run something in a VM and not in a container like Docker container or any other tech like unikernels and others that I don&amp;rsquo;t know about :p
Now, back to VMs. Now, usually I used to use Virtual Box to run VMs in my local. It&amp;rsquo;s open source and I can run it in my Mac.</description>

      <description>I consider myself a bit forgetful. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to tell the reasons for that, but I think I know some reasons ü§î anyways, now, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can solve the problem and remember more things. And even if I do, it will take time and till then, I need some mechanism to help me remember things. So, what do I do? Other than my brain, what can store lots of information and not forget it very easily?</description>

      <description>So today I was planning to travel in a van to a metro station and then in metro, go to the metro station near my house and then walk to my house which is close by
Unfortunately my van didn&amp;rsquo;t come. I then walked to a bus station and got a bus to the metro station. Now I had to pay, in cash for the bus fare. And I realized that I might not have cash in my wallet.</description>

Exec / execute into a pod If you have kube-fzf, you can use execpod which is an interactive way to exec into a pod&amp;rsquo;s container
$ # exec into a pod in the default namespace $ execpod $ # exec into a pod in a particular namespace $ execpod -n &amp;lt;namespace-name&amp;gt; $ # exec into a pod in any namespace by seeing all namespace pods $ execpod -a Or if you don&amp;rsquo;t have kube-fzf, you can use the below</description>

      <description>I recently thought I should share some of my Open Source Stories! Stories about how I contributed, what happened, some learnings, swags and what not. Anything that happened with respect to Open Source for me. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write as much stories as possible! Not all of them will have technical stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s a story :P It could have anything. So, today I have one story to tell ;)</description>

      <description>Have you ever tried to record your terminal? Or seen anyone&amp;rsquo;s recording of their terminal? Usually people record to show how a tool works and put it in the tool&amp;rsquo;s README in the git repo. You can also record to do tutorial videos and more :)
So, my first thought to record my terminal would have been to just record my screen or terminal window using some screen recording / screen capture tool like Kap.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: These are just my thoughts. Or rants. :P
Every day I code. I face problems. Usually I get immersed in the problem. These days I try to be lazy. I try. I think of how to go past the problem, get rid of it, not face it in the future, make my life easier.
I also don&amp;rsquo;t like to sit idle, waiting for my tests and build. I have a macbook pro 2017 version and even that&amp;rsquo;s not enough sometimes üôà we really need to work on better software folks.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve planned to run a bit. To practice for a marathon - 5km one. I have run crazily once for 7.5 km. Almost killed myself in the process üòÇ
Yesterday I ran okay. I ran twice yesterday. Both times quite slowly, atleast that&amp;rsquo;s what I believe. It looked like I was running very slowly. But you should have seen the amount of energy that I was spending to do that.</description>

      <description>Have you ever done remote pair programming over the Internet? Or tried to share your screen over the Internet to show someone something on your screen? Using slack, team viewer, zoom, and what not. How was the experience?
Being a programmer, I&amp;rsquo;m sure a lot of you spend your time in the terminal, editor / IDE and the browser? And probably more! Like slack :P
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s say, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use slack / zoom to just do audio call over the Internet, or use something like Google Meet or even just a phone call using my mobile network or over the Internet using WhatsApp</description>

      <description>So, today I found something funny and interesting. Someone in our slack #tech-reads channel shared a tech read by antirez, the creator of redis software. This is the link that they shared -
http://antirez.com/news/123
I immediately tried out the command in my terminal and it was cool! See the recording here -
 The commands used in the recording are below
$ redis-cli 127.0.0.1:6379&amp;gt; lolwut 127.0.0.1:6379&amp;gt; lolwut 10 1 4 127.</description>

      <description>Long ago, in one post I wrote about how to debug Go program in Intellij IDEA / Goland. I realized not everyone uses IDEA ecosystem though, as they are paid. You could check out the IDEA community edition though, which is free. And you can install the Go plugin from here. In my case I used to use IDEA Ultimate and evaluate it (Evaluator version) for free, now I use a company license.</description>

He knew that I have been cycling a bit recently. He asked if I wanted to come. I said okay and started planning for this event
The theme being &amp;ldquo;pedal to fight cancer&amp;rdquo;. The fund from the event would go to Cancer children at Adyar Cancer Institute in Chennai, where I live

Two things that I have tried recently - sandwiches and omelette wraps. üòÇ This is my own recipe - so my version of how I made the food, and how I named it too üòõ
Sandwich Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the sandwich
I got some veggies first - cucumber, carrot, tomato and some sprouts. I decided the sprouts will be like a side dish.</description>

I use the smart bike app to get a rented cycle and I got a helmet for my saftey and I drive almost everyday in the morning and sometimes I have ridden in the evening too during weekends
So, why and how did I start doing this?
I think the first inspiration for me is my friend Nimalan. Who started cycling and putting posts about his trips and more.</description>

Aman has finished the problem and he is acting as though he&amp;rsquo;s not done and is pretending he&amp;rsquo;s thinking about the problem and is looking around to pretend he wants help. While looking around he is thinking &amp;ldquo;Damn, I wish I could keep looking at Rahul.</description>

Arvind: Wow, this is all so grand! Let&amp;rsquo;s find a place to sit and enjoy the day and find new friends maybe!

      <description>Recently me and a friend were trying to debug a stackoverflow error in helm. We used a lot of print statements in the code and were reading the code and seeing the flow and checking where it just blew up. At some point I realized we were putting lot of print statements and it was just becoming tedious to follow along the big code - it was some parsing code üòì to parse the command line values.</description>

      <description>Recently Helm 3 alpha version was released https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.1 üéâ. There are lot of new things in this release, I wanted to write about one of these things - Pushing Charts to OCI Registries!
With helm 3, you can push your charts to container registries similar to pushing container images! TLDR; Show me your terminal!
 The commands being used in the video:
$ docker run -dp 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry $ helm create my-chart $ ls $ helm chart save my-chart localhost:5000/my-chart:0.</description>

      <description>I think the first time I heard the term &amp;ldquo;Open Source&amp;rdquo; was when we were taught about different kinds of software in 12th grade. I still remember how we had so many defintions to remember, for terms like - proprietary, freeware, shareware, open source software. I&amp;rsquo;m able to recall only these terms. Also, the definitions had some similarities and I also remember getting confused about the differences and similarities between the terms.</description>
