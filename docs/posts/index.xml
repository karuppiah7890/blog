      <description>Long ago, in one post I wrote about how to debug Go program in Intellij IDEA / Goland. I realized not everyone uses IDEA ecosystem though, as they are paid. You could check out the IDEA community edition though, which is free. And you can install the Go plugin from here. In my case I used to use IDEA Ultimate and evaluate it (Evaluator version) for free, now I use a company license.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine recently shared some posters about a cyclathon / cycle rally
He knew that I have been cycling a bit recently. He asked if I wanted to come. I said okay and started planning for this event
The theme being &amp;ldquo;pedal to fight cancer&amp;rdquo;. The fund from the event would go to Cancer children at Adyar Cancer Institute in Chennai, where I live
The first thought was - it&amp;rsquo;s too early 😂 But I just registered.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been so cool to make my own breakfast. Like, some of it, if not all
Two things that I have tried recently - sandwiches and omelette wraps. 😂 This is my own recipe - so my version of how I made the food, and how I named it too 😛
Sandwich Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the sandwich
I got some veggies first - cucumber, carrot, tomato and some sprouts. I decided the sprouts will be like a side dish.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been cycling for about two weeks now
I use the smart bike app to get a rented cycle and I got a helmet for my saftey and I drive almost everyday in the morning and sometimes I have ridden in the evening too during weekends
So, why and how did I start doing this?
I think the first inspiration for me is my friend Nimalan. Who started cycling and putting posts about his trips and more.</description>

      <description>This is a story by me :)
 We are in a grade 10 class in AllCool School. Students are studying chemistry and their professor has asked them to solve a problem
Aman has finished the problem and he is acting as though he&amp;rsquo;s not done and is pretending he&amp;rsquo;s thinking about the problem and is looking around to pretend he wants help. While looking around he is thinking &amp;ldquo;Damn, I wish I could keep looking at Rahul.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s a constant buzz around him. People talking about life and work.

      <description>Recently me and a friend were trying to debug a stackoverflow error in helm. We used a lot of print statements in the code and were reading the code and seeing the flow and checking where it just blew up. At some point I realized we were putting lot of print statements and it was just becoming tedious to follow along the big code - it was some parsing code 😓 to parse the command line values.</description>

      <description>Recently Helm 3 alpha version was released https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.1 🎉. There are lot of new things in this release, I wanted to write about one of these things - Pushing Charts to OCI Registries!
With helm 3, you can push your charts to container registries similar to pushing container images! TLDR; Show me your terminal!
 The commands being used in the video:
$ docker run -dp 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry $ helm create my-chart $ ls $ helm chart save my-chart localhost:5000/my-chart:0.</description>

      <description>I think the first time I heard the term &amp;ldquo;Open Source&amp;rdquo; was when we were taught about different kinds of software in 12th grade. I still remember how we had so many defintions to remember, for terms like - proprietary, freeware, shareware, open source software. I&amp;rsquo;m able to recall only these terms. Also, the definitions had some similarities and I also remember getting confused about the differences and similarities between the terms.</description>
