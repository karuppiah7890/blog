I think that some of the best things one can do in any
profession they are in are - to learn and to teach others, and
also give feedback to others. I feel this also applies to life in
general.

We are in the era where knowledge and experience are of immense value.
It can make your health and life better. It can make your career better.

I believe you can learn from anyone and from anywhere. I have seen a lot
of people tell that the one thing you should be careful about is -
thinking that you are the smartest person in the room. Another
being - actually being the "smartest" person in the room. Both mean
that - you already know  it "all" and that you are not going to learn or
are not willing to learn. It's not a great place to be in. There's
always something new to learn, something better, something fascinating,
something that makes your life way easier. Don't let arrogance / ego /
ignorance get to you. Be smart, be aware.

I think many people do learn something everyday, at work or in life.
But many stop there. "Wait, what's more? what's next?" you ask? What
about teaching others? Not everyone is sharing their learnings I think.
Are you sharing your learnings? Depending on your background, you might
or might not ask "Why should I? What do I get out of it?". Well, some
people are paid to share their learnings through books, workshops
and talks and what not. Personally, I'm not that much of a great fan
of paid resources, but yeah, I have heard great things about some
paid resources. Probably it's true. I'll never know until I try it out
properly ðŸ˜‚ . Few others, who have "trade secrets" that cannot be shared
because it's worth a lot of money, or it just does not belongs to
them - Company stuff and Non Disclosure Agreements, and is not their's, 
I get you, I guess? Others, they may ask "Why should I share knowledge,
what do I get out of it? I don't get paid or anything". I don't have a
concrete answer to it. Even if I had, I don't know if it would convince
everyone with the question - some people just aren't convinced easily.
But I can tell you this - if everyone had this mentality of sharing
knowledge, inlcuding you, then, how would that look like? "Everyone" is 
a broad term so let's put it in some context. Let's say you are in a 
profession and work in a team. If all of you shared your knowledge, how
would that look like? I think you will start to realize that you not
only share, but also gain knowledge when others share with you. And how
will that happen? Sharing is contageous and with some encouragement,
almost everyone will share knowledge. I think you start to see the
[Ubuntu philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy) 
then - "I am because we are". Remember, if you share knowledge, your 
team gets better, and now you get to work in a team that's a bit better
than before because you and others shared knowledge, and you are also 
part of your team, so you would be saying - "I am able to work better
than  before because we are all better than before. As a team we are
doing better." You can extrapolate the concept to a community in the 
organization and then to an organization, and then to the next level -
to a community in the outside world, an area in the city, then state, 
then country, then the globe, then to the space with astronaust and
aliens :P

There are many other reasons to teaching and sharing knowledge and
many effects too. 

## Individual level effects



And there are many forms of knowledge sharing too
