I have made tons of mistakes. This post is about mistakes and how you can learn from them like I have, but maybe without making those mistakes like I did ;) :)

Let people move forward with their ideas instead of blocking them. Even let is the wrong word - let means - either I have the authority or power to stop them, or I have some sort of nagging or similar capability to annoy them and block them or stop them. Both of which are not right and not acceptable in my book

I have usually noticed myself at times to get into a bubble and have a strong opinion and act like "It's my way or the high way" only to realize later I shouldn't so controlling or opinionated and could just keep quiet and not nag people with possible problems I can think of and trust me, I usually always think of problems for any ideas - including my own ideas ðŸ˜† I have had people ask me to recommend solutions by saying something along the lines of "It's confusing as to what you recommend. Your statements don't seem to choose or recommend one approach though they talk about a lot of approaches and possible pros and cons"

Being the person with lot of access - oh my god. This is the worst
