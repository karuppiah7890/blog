I go to her place imagining what she's probably wearing

I see her waiting for me outside with the big basket of clothes

As I approach her, I see her. There she is. In pure white. And she isn't smiling. I wonder why

I finally reach her. She hands the basket and gives me some shillings and then some extra and says "Just make sure it goes away. It's a new dress"

No one ever gives me extra shillings if the stains are hard to remove. Except her. 

I keep imagining about her while walking to my house

I scrubbed a lot but I still couldn't remove the rainbow stain completely from her white dress. 

It's crazy how she understands my pain and gives me extra shillings but I can't even imagine about her pain. It puts a burden on my heart.

I go back to her place the next day. There she stands, eagerly waiting for her stainless dresses. I happen to be the bearer of the bad news, telling her "I couldn't remove them completely. Sorry. Here are your extra shillings". 

"It's not your fault. You tried your best. Keep the shillings." she said, pushing my hand with shillings towards me.

She received the basket and went inside with a frown on her face.

I walked to my house imagining how I could have told her it's not her fault. But I think she already knows that
