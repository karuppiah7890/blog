So I've planned to run a bit. To practice for a marathon - 5km one. I have run crazily once for 7.5 km.
Almost killed myself in the process 😂

Yesterday I ran okay. I ran twice yesterday. Both times quite slowly, atleast that's what I believe. It
looked like I was running very slowly. But you should have seen the amount of energy that I was spending to
do that. 😅🙈 While cycling, I wouldn't sweat much I think. I don't even feel like I'm sweating until I'm
done cycling, which is after an hour or so. But running, I was just running for a few minutes and I could
feel my sweat all over my body! Really, running takes the juice out of me. Literally 😂

I was also breathing very heavily while running. Like a lot. I don't know why. I think I'll start checking
out how to run without getting tired. I remember bookmarking some articles for it :p need to read em. 

And how much do you think I ran yesterday after getting quite tired? One km each time. Morning once. Evening
once. That's it. My Strava stats told me I didn't burn any calories 🤣 I was like "what. Hmm. Damn!" But
seriously, running ain't easy. 😅🙈 I'm gonna make sure I can run lots. I'm gonna practice everyday to see
how I can do.

Also, another new thing that has happened is - I don't care about what others think now, while running. At
least, I'm getting there I think. Previously, I used to feel awkward, running around, all alone in the
morning. Cycling is easy - I go away fast :p anyways. Now I run around with everyone, actually, may be not
everyone, but with some of em looking at me. I'm also looking at em. And I still keep running. I think I've
become stronger now. Being able to do what I wanna do - which is running in this case, without thinking
about what the other person in front of me thinks 

Below are the Strava stats for the runs I mentioned -

Have you tried out running? What's your experience? ;)
