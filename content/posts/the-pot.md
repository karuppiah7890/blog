Started off to write a poem. It turned out to be something else. :P


# The Pot

Everyone's born with a pot.  
A very special kind of pot,  
which is very much connected  
to you and has life in it.  

When you are young,  
it's soft and big.  
And it's prone to breaking.  
And breaks most times.  

People always break it.  
But the best part is,  
it heals on it's own.  
Like The Wolverine? :P  
Sometimes.  
Time heals it, as usual.  

As the person grows,  
the pot becomes harder and smaller.  
Harder because it has broken   
many times. So it becomes  
strong and immune.  

An interesting thing about   
pots is, you cannot see a pot.  
You can only feel it.  
Only a pot can see another pot.  

And my Pot. Well. It was very normal.  
Even after breaking a lot of times.  

"breaking" - You have no idea.  
People have hammered it. Sniped it.  
And have done the worst things.  
And still. It healed every time.  
But yeah. It's just usual for some people.  
The "breaking" thingy.  

As I said, it "was" very normal. But now.  
I am not able to feel it at times.  
I mean. It's getting lost at times!  

It took me long to find out   
where it was getting lost.  
Whenever I see her it gets lost.  
Whenever I think about her,  
it get's lost.   
How I found it? Well. Later,  
I could feel my pot whenever she  
was nearby. It was with her pot.  
It was in the right place  
and wasn't getting lost.  

It's true. The quote.   
"Sometimes the Pot sees what's invisible to the eyes"
