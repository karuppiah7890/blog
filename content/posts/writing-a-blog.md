Have read very few things about writing blogs
Have also heard a bit of recommendations

Goals of your blog

What I chucked out - Google Analytics, SEO, advertisement on public platforms

Platform to write - I chose a hard one. Choose easy ones - define your own easy.
Look for the features you want for your blog - ease of use, editing with GUI,
page loading, compression of images for different screen sizes, accessibility,
analytics, RSS feed, comments, email subscription for new posts and weekly
newsletters, tagging, search, fancy themes, attached forum for members who can
login and participate, special stuff for members, paywall for members? attached
goodies shop, domain name - .com , .io , SEO friendly, responsive site, time to
publish and go live, feature to save drafts, feature for series of blog posts to
link to series automatically instead you typing about it in your content,
sharing features of the blog post - when embedding links on other websites, show
nice and fancy previews with images and description and keep it search friendly
