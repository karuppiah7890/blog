Many front end javascript files are bundled into one file usually,
and all the spaces removed, all function and variable names
changed - minified. I don't know what else they do as part of
"minification" process and bundling process. Finally you get that
obscure JavaScript file. This also reduces the size of the file and
hence the amount of data to be downloaded, which makes a big difference,
especially for people with low network bandwidth or bad Internet. Also,
another advantage to it is - people cannot read your code? And if
you do security stuff in it, people won't know I guess? :P "Security
through obscurity". Actually some have the opinion that people can just
open source their front end code and that ideally, they shouldn't do
secretive stuff in their front end code and keep it secure and hidden
using minification process. Anyways, those are just my thoughts and
what I have heard about "obscure javascript"! :)
