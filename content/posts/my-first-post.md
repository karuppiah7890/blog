Now that you are reading this post, it means I finally created *another* blog and hosted it too 😛 Yay! 🎉

My previous blogs that I hosted using Blogger during college -

And now I have created [this blog](https://karuppiah7890.github.io/blog). I use these to create and host it:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Markdown Emoji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-emoji) to put the awesome emojis in markdown 😁

Hoping to write tons of posts 😉 Stay tuned!
