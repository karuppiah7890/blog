Long ago, [in one post](/blog/posts/debugging-go-in-intellij-idea-or-goland/) I wrote about how to debug Go
program in Intellij IDEA / Goland. I realized not everyone uses IDEA ecosystem though, as they are paid. You
could check out the IDEA community edition though, which is free. And you can install the Go plugin from
[here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9568-go). In my case I used to use IDEA Ultimate and evaluate it
(Evaluator version) for free, now I use a company license. But of course there are other text editors and
IDEs that you can use to write Go code. One such famous one is Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as you might
already know. I tried to debug the [same helm issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6079) as my last
Intellij post using VS Code and checked how easy it was. Turns out it's pretty easy and similar to IDEA. I
just had to create a configuration and that's it. Here are the steps that I followed :

Prerequisite - Make sure you have the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.Go) installed in VS Code

Steps:

In the left bar, there will be a bug shaped icon, click it

![left-bar-with-bug-icon](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/left-bar-with-bug-icon.png "left-bar-with-bug-icon")

Now you will see the debug side bar. Choose "Run and Debug" button in this

![debug-bar-new](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/debug-bar-new.png "debug-bar-new")

And then you can choose Go when it asks for what environment

![choose-golang-from-options](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/choose-golang-from-options.png "choose-golang-from-options")

Now, it will create a default `launch.json` file for you inside `.vscode` directory in the root of your
project. It will look like this

![launch-json-file-1](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/launch-json-file-1.png "launch-json-file-1")

For my use case, I modified it like this

![launch-json-file-2](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/launch-json-file-2.png "launch-json-file-2")

There are multiple configurations that you can provide. For example, you can provide the program arguments like in the above example. I used it to debug a [linting issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6079) hence the lint subcommand, so VS Code will run something like

```
$ helm lint /Users/karuppiahoss/helm-stable-repo/apm-server-2.1.4.tgz /Users/karuppiahoss/helm-stable-repo/atlantis-3.7.0.tgz
```

Now, once the configuration is done, you are good to go and debug your program ;)

Now you can run and debug it with the play icon button in the debug side bar. Before debugging you need to add breakpoints to your program code - wherever you want to stop the program and see the data present in the variables and you can evaluate expressions too!

And while debugging you can add breakpoints on the go and you can add breakpoints anywhere in the program execution! Like even in the standard library code execution! See below for examples of putting breakpoints and how I have put breakpoints in the [template golang stdblib](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)

![breakpoint-1](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/breakpoint-1.png "breakpoint-1")

![breakpoint-2](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/breakpoint-2.png "breakpoint-2")

![breakpoint-3](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/breakpoint-3.png "breakpoint-3")

![breakpoint-4](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/breakpoint-4.png "breakpoint-4")

![breakpoint-5](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/breakpoint-5.png "breakpoint-5")

If you notice the image below (the VS code breadcrumb path), I have a breakpoint in the golang standard library packages [text/template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template)

![breakpoint-6](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/breakpoint-6.png "breakpoint-6")

Here's how the debug window looks like when on a breakpoint. This is the breakpoint in the [text/template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template) library. 

![debug-window-and-console](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/debug-window-and-console.png "debug-window-and-console")

Look how I have also accessed the variable `data` in the console. You can also keep typing again and again in the console :P See below

![typing-multiple-thing-in-debug-console](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/typing-multiple-thing-in-debug-console.png "typing-multiple-thing-in-debug-console")

You can also dig into the variable if it's a struct or map, like this

![looking-inside-data-in-console](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/looking-inside-data-in-console.png "looking-inside-data-in-console")

So, now you can get a single value in a variable with nested data types! :) See this - 

![getting-a-single-value-in-a-nested-data](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/getting-a-single-value-in-a-nested-data.png "getting-a-single-value-in-a-nested-data")

Now, let's say you can't keep checking this single value and wait for it to change to some particular
value. What do you do? You can also add conditional breakpoints by right clicking on the breakpoint and
choosing `Edit Breakpoint`! You can also add breakpoint based on hit count, and also log messages when the
breakpoint is hit ;) :D See below to see how conditional breakpoint works. For others, I recommend
experimenting it yourself ;)

![conditional-breakpoint](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/conditional-breakpoint.png "conditional-breakpoint")

So, the expression I used is `data.(chartutil.Values)["Chart"].(*chart.Metadata).Name=="atlantis"`. Now, you
can see below to see how the conditional breakpoint stops correctly when the expression is true. See the console to see how
the expression value is `atlantis`, which is a Helm Chart name for [Atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/)

![see-how-conditional-breakpoint-stops-correctly](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/see-how-conditional-breakpoint-stops-correctly.png "see-how-conditional-breakpoint-stops-correctly")

You can add some watches for values too! Here's a screenshot for the same

![watch-expression](/blog/img/debugging-go-in-vs-code/watch-expression.png "watch-expression")

So that's how you debug a Go program. That's all folks! If you have any questions shoot them below! ðŸ˜„

PS: This post was meant to be written last year, just after the [Intellij golang debugging post](/blog/posts/debugging-go-in-intellij-idea-or-goland/). I finally finished it with the help of all the resources (screenshots) that I had got last year ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ Planned to reuse them, but then created some new screenshots and got one from the Internet too! :)

May be sometime I'll record videos on how to debug too, using VS code :) ;)
