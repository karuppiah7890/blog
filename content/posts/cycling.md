I've been cycling for about two weeks now

I use the [smart bike](https://www.smartbikemobility.com/en/delhi/smartbike-landing-page/) [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nextbike.smartbike) to get a rented cycle and I got a [helmet](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8328686_mountain-bike-helmet-500-black.html) for my saftey and I drive almost everyday in the morning and sometimes I have ridden in the evening too during weekends

So, why and how did I start doing this?

I think the first inspiration for me is my friend Nimalan. Who started cycling and putting posts about his trips and more. He uses the Strava app

And then later, I saw another friend of mine do it too. Somehow I got this idea of cycling. I have cycled before using rented cycles. But very very little. Later I didn't do it much. 

Now, I've been doing some crazy stuff cycling. I started going quite some long distances. 5 KMs, 10 KMs, and now recently 20 KMs :D I'm also travelling to new places. Somehow I get bored of already travelled routes and roads. Also, I like to ride on good and clean and neat roads. So the plan is to just keep checking out more and more places. 

I'm also trying to plan my time and distance is usually accordingly planned. It somehow happens that the max I go is 20KM. I think it's mostly because of the time. Previously the max I went was 10 KM. 

And I ride in the morning. After the ride, I need to go to office, so I need to be back on time and hence plan well. When I was doing 5KM, I started my ride at 6:30 am or about that time. And I had to be back by 7 am or so, so that I can start for office at 7:40 am. My ride start time then moved to about 6am, with 10KM travel. And then I realized that - for me to go more than 10KM with the given time constraints, I needed to wake up earlier and start earlier. I started waking up at around 5 am and started travel around 5:30 am and started doing 20 KM. The route, I started checking which routes I haven't tried and which parts of the city I can go from my house and return in a given amount of time, and also look out for some places I already know. Like beaches, metro train stations, parks. I think I'm going to try out more places ;) and I might get a bike too, with more gears. The only main constraint is money for bike üòÖüòÇ and then maintenance cost too. I can afford it, but not sure if it will be entirely worth and okay for me to spend money on this. I'm usually the kind of guy who tries to spend less on some stuff, and sometimes spend a lot on some stuff ü§£ Also, if I buy the bike and then not ride it much later, then, well, it will be a waste of money. I don't know. I think I'll ride it. But I don't know. Let's see

Also, all this while, I have been riding alone. It's been good. Like, really good. I like me time and being alone, sometimes. But many have asked me to ride with other folks, in groups. Some pros to it is I get to hangout with folks who do tons of cycling and know a lot about it and could train me on the same. Let's see if I join some group. May be I can do a combo. Sometimes ride alone. Sometimes ride with the group ;)

My Strava profile is here - https://www.strava.com/athletes/42094106

I also tried running once. It was hard üôà Other than that, I do a lot of walking, actually, some
of my walking, I forget to start tracking in Strava üòù I guess I'll start doing that better
going forward to see how much I really walk. Below are some phone screenshots and my pics. I have taken
very few pics actually üòÇüòÇüòÇ
