In today's Software Development world, almost everyone relies on existing
software to build their core software or to make their life easier. In this
post, when I say software, I'm referring to any software - tools, libraries,
web apps, web services, desktop apps, mobile apps, programming languages, and
almost any software that you can find under the sun when it comes to the
software development industry.

Have you ever felt that sometimes the softwares you use are hindering you and
not enabling you? Have you ever wondered why that's the case?

I have noticed in my case that sometimes, the softwares I use are not helping 
me. I even get frustrated thinking how the software should enable me. Upon wondering how to go about understanding the core of the problem, I thought about a few points that made sense to me:

- Every software is created for some particular purpose(s) / use case(s)
- Knowledge and experience with the software is important to be able to use the software
  the right way

I feel that sometimes we make the mistake of choosing the wrong software for our job and hence face the issues of the software hindering us. It's pretty important to understand the problems and use case the software was built for. Whenever you choose a software, be sure to understand the software's "Why?", that is "Why does this software exist? What problems does it solve? How does it solve it? What are some example use case(s)?". Usually the software's resources - website, homepage, docs etc should give out this information. It's important to understand your software in this aspect before choosing it.

Even if one has chosen the right software for the right job, it's sometimes possible that the software is hindering the user. Why would that be the case? It's possible the user is using the software in a way that it wasn't intended to. Every software has been built to be used in a particular way for solving a particular set of problems. Ideally, the creator(s) of the software should have created the software intuitively, to make sure that the user always uses it the right way. But this is not very easily possible in all softwares - usually it's very easy to restrict in GUI softwares, but not very easy to make things very clear when it comes to web services / APIs, CLI softwares, libraries
