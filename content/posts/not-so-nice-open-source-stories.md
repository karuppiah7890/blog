I haven't been contributing any code to Open Source for a long time now, so I might be a bit rusty, so pardon me üòÖ

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This blog post paints a not so rosy picture of open source and is derived from my personal experience. If you are not looking forward to reading such a post, I recommend you to stop reading right now. You have been warned! üòÖ

First off, I actually used to love Open Source. I think I still do, but I can't say for sure though üòÖ I do like things being open, knowledge and education being open, than a very hush hush kind of mentality. So, that's 1 point for Open Source! :)

Now, with all that said, and with all the previous blog posts I have written about Open Source, and how cool and great it is, I'm going to paint a bit of a weird / dark picture in the next few lines based on what problems I see in Open Source, based on my experience

Let's start with contributing code. I remember how addictive I used to be to contribute to Open Source. I couldn't sit still üòÇ I was at level 1 for a long time. I think I'm still at level 1, haha. I was basically very comfortable at the kind of contributions I was doing. It was pretty basic - find small bugs and report, fix small issues, and what not. A few very a bit harder to do, many were okayish. Very few I struggled a lot and didn't continue to see it through. Most times I struggled because I overcommitted to contributing to multiple issues in different repos or the same repo, only ending up burnt out

Now let's talk about the kind of contributions I was making and what I noticed. If you are a seasoned Open Source contributor, you would know by now that every Open Source project works in it's own way and there's no one way fits all though many follow some standard / traditional practices, usually the so called "good" or "best" practices

I remember reading the project guidelines for many projects and contributing, sometimes I used to miss reading them, assuming it's mostly the same old and I knew the language and tooling, so I read it sometimes at the end while rasing the Pull Request. Now  the tricky thing is - sometimes I never spoke to the maintainers or commented on issues that I'm working on something. And then I notice many others working on the same thing, only to realize it was duplicate effort and only one pull request can be merged by the maintainer.

Fortunately I realized this mistake soon and always commented about things like - if I'm working on the issue, or if I'm pausing or dropping the work so that someone else can pick it up. I started noticing how contributors stepped on each others toes even in such cases, because they never bothered to read the issue comments.

Some funny things I have noticed are - some people create issues only when they are ready with a pull request ;) I still consider trying that out some day ;) :D

So, why does all this duplicate work / working on the same issue happen? I mean, what's going on? Well, the reality is - there are many people who are trying to contribute and when many end up in the same project but the project has only so many low hanging fruits / good first issues, that they start fighting. They start stepping on each others toes. The wrath of the human population and hence competition can be seen clearly in such places üòÖ

At some point I told myself that I would never pick an easy issue to work on. It's funny because I'm more likely to easily complete the easy ones. But then, I would go back to the same story of stepping on each others toes, trying to "compete" and get our Pull Request merged. I didn't wanna participate in that weird competition so I kind of gave that up. But funnily, even till date, because of habit, the first thing I do is - look for "good first issues" for example on GitHub and see tens and hundreds of people commenting on it, and probably many said "I'm interested to work on this"

Let me give an example of another incident. Remember how I told that I rarely read the documentation on contributing? Well that lead to writing a lot of code without discussing with the core maintainers. This happened just once. Later there was a lot of back and forth in the Pull request and then I don't remember what happened later - if it got merged or not

I remember multiple times raising a PR and getting it closed, because someone else raised a similar PR probably with some better features / with the response of the reviewers. Or sometimes the maintainers themselves raise an alternate PR. And this felt so bad. I was basically so addicted to contributing that I so wanted to contribute instead of seeing the maintainer merge their PR and superseding my small PR. When I got annoyed and acted out, people tried to make me understand. But I wasn't mature enough then. Again, this happened with usually small PRs. Same thing again. In my head I used to be like "If you want to push and merge your code, then why let me go through all this effort and raise a PR?!" and it's more annoying when a maintainer says in nice words that they welcome PRs, only to change decisions later at times and not communicate that they require something else in the PR review. This one time, the maintainer didn't give reviews to tell me to do or about any changes and went ahead and implemented everything that was ideally part of my PR
