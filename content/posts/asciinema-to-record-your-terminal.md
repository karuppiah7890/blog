Have you ever tried to record your terminal? Or seen anyone's recording of their terminal? Usually
people record to show how a tool works and put it in the tool's README in the git repo. You can also
record to do tutorial videos and more :)

So, my first thought to record my terminal would have been to just record my screen or terminal window
using some screen recording / screen capture tool like [Kap](https://getkap.co/). Turns out there are other
ways and tools to record your terminal ;) One such tool is [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/)

asciinema is a tool that makes it very easy to record and share your terminal sessions. It's lightweight,
and purely text based - so, not exactly a video, so, no mp4 files and such :P You can easily share your
terminal sessions on the web. 

You can find a brief description of how it works [here](https://asciinema.org/docs/how-it-works) and also 
links to dig deep too

So, how does it help? Now, usually, when you record with screen recorder and play it as a video, you cannot
copy the commands shown in the video. It's a video, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Now with asciinema player, it plays the 
terminal session and you can pause and also copy the commands in it! How cool is that? And it's pretty 
lightweight and there will not be any resolution problems because it's not exactly a video! And you can 
also change the theme of the terminal session when sharing and asciinema also has a platform for you to 
share your sessions online with your own account and sharing settings. And you don't need the online 
asciinema platform to play your recording, you can play it anywhere in anyone's laptop if you have the
recording file and the `asciinema` tool. I've recorded a video to show a demo of asciinema. It's below
and you can also see the asciinema recorded terminal session in a special asciinema player below :) More 
about sharing and embedding asciinema recording can be found [here](https://asciinema.org/docs/embedding)
