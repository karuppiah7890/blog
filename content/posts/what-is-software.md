A software is more than just source code. This is true for anything. Any
creation. The creation may be defined by people in just a few words, the reality
is, there are always people behind the creation. There's always a people aspect
to things. In Software, this means everyone involved with the software - all of
the teams of developers, product managers, quality analysts, project managers,
and Every other than Role who helped build the software and is part of the
company behind the software. And then all those meetings with lots of people to
plan, discuss technology and what not, all those hours spent, discussing about
the software. All the people using the software, for so much time. All the
people benefiting from the software, all the people getting annoyed by the
software, all those bugs and tickets for those bugs, all those customer support
calls. There's just a lot behind every Software and the same applies to all
creations.

What does that mean? For me, it means that there's always a story behind
everything, including software. If you remember it, tell it to people. I make
sure that I remember it, by writing down whenever I do stuff. I try to write it
all down as much as possible. It's not easy. But I try :) Some day I'll tell
more stories than I have ever told, I guess.

One important thing I feel about these stories is - once you know the story,
you understand why something happened. It's not easy to know everything about a
story, then that becomes a huge biography that becomes hard to consume as a
whole. But if you can even give a gist of the story, it might help someone know
what happened, know what's the history, learn from your success and failures.
I think I like history. Funnily I didn't feel the same way about history when
I was young :P That's a topic for another day I guess :P
