It's been so cool to make my own breakfast. Like, some of it, if not all

Two things that I have tried recently - sandwiches and omelette wraps. ðŸ˜‚ This is my own recipe - so  my version of how I made the food, and how I named it too ðŸ˜›

## Sandwich

Let's start with the sandwich

I got some veggies first - cucumber, carrot, tomato and some sprouts. I decided the sprouts will be
like a side dish. Just trying to eat healthy :P

And I got two bread slices which I put in the toaster

And then I got some stuffing for my sandwich - egg fry

![sandwich-3](/blog/img/cooking/sandwich-3.jpg "sandwich-3")

Got my bread toasted then

![sandwich-4](/blog/img/cooking/sandwich-4.jpg "sandwich-4")

And then I put chutney on my crispy toasted bread :D

And then I put the egg fry on top of one of the slices

And then I added some veggies on one side. At some point I realized, I was stuffing a lot,
but I wanted to :P so, instead of piling up on one side alone, I decided to distribute the
veggies on both sides and then somehow put the other slice on top of the first one :P

And then I got these two yummy seasoning bottles. First one being black pepper grinder

And then a salad seasoning grinder

I grinded em a lot on my veggies :P

Now. Something was missing. Tomato Sauce! Tomato Ketchup! Whatever :P

Then I closed the yummy thing

Yummy, filling big sandwich ready :P

## Omelette Wrap

Now the next thing that I made is - omelette wrap. I actually wanted to make a proper
roll like wrap, where the omelette would be rolled into a shape like cylinder. But I
couldn't make it like that. ðŸ˜… Let's see what happened :P and how I handled the situation!

So, first, I got an omelette :P and then some veggies and sprouts and chutney

![omelette-wrap-1](/blog/img/cooking/omelette-wrap-1.jpg "omelette-wrap-1")

I spread some chutney on the omelette

![omelette-wrap-2](/blog/img/cooking/omelette-wrap-2.jpg "omelette-wrap-2")

And then kept some veggies on one side of the omelette, so that I could roll it
like a chapati. But I realized that the omelette is too soft and it didn't make
sense to roll it and also, the size was too small. So I decided I'll just fold it
and eat it :P so I put veggies on both sides, like this

![omelette-wrap-3](/blog/img/cooking/omelette-wrap-3.jpg "omelette-wrap-3")

And then I just folded it

![omelette-wrap-4](/blog/img/cooking/omelette-wrap-4.jpg "omelette-wrap-4")

And then cut it into three pieces. It looked too cute :P I felt like a pro ðŸ˜‚

![omelette-wrap-5](/blog/img/cooking/omelette-wrap-5.jpg "omelette-wrap-5")

After this, I realized I forgot to add the main ingredient! My little bottle
of spices - the salad seasoning and black pepper. I added them on the top
then :P Then I ate it ;)

Those were my foodventures :P I'll post more when I have more foodventures!
I made all this in my office. So, I have this idea now - have some challenge
or something, and ask people to get creative and cook something and eat :)
No winners or losers, meh. Just food fun. :P ;) Let's see if I make it happen ðŸ˜Ž
