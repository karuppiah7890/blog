These might look more like etiquettes :P

Write the email body first. Write "To", "Bcc", "cc" fields later. This is to
avoid sending the email by mistake.
Have undo send email feature if it's available. In case you are using Gmail,
it's available.

Don't just send Hi / Hello. Send more information. nohello.com . Or use the ping
message maybe. But, ideally, a full message about why you are pinging is better.
For most people, ping is as good as hi / hello. So, yeah.

When sending email to many people using your email client, it's better to use
your email in the "To" field and to use others emails in the "Bcc" field in case
you want to respect the privacy of the people you are sending the email to. This
is usually useful when you are sending announcements or some sort of individual
emails to some set of individuals, who don't really need to who know who else
got the email and what's their identity. If it's a group message where everyone
needs to know who are the members of the group email, then go ahead and use "To"
or "cc", though "cc" is only more for informative purposes than for action or
a targeted receiver I guess

When replying to emails, be aware of whom you are replying to. Be conscious
about "Reply", "Reply all" features in your email client. Sometimes just "Reply"
is enough, maybe "Reply all" is more of a spam for some of the people present in
the email thread.

Try to use text mostly, and less of multimedia like images. If using images,
don't put too much information in it, instead just have visual stuff and also
have some sort of alternate text attached to the image. This is for
accessibility reasons. If you are in a workplace, you need to be inclusive of
everyone, including people with disability using screen readers which are going
to find it hard to read multimedia like images.

Most people prefer short emails. If you have long emails, that's fine, use an
extra TLDR; as much as possible which will give people a gist about the email.

Chat - Try to not use @here , @channel , @all and similar tags in chat rooms.
These tags must be used in very rare cases when you need to make announcements.
Even with announcements, people usually have dedicated channels and email lists
or groups for it. Such tags notify so many people in a given channel that it's
usually counter productive to use it too much - because when you use it too much
then people will not care about what anyone puts with the tag to mention all,
they will just ignore. Too much noise is just spam. Use it judiciously. It's
like a PA system - Public Announcement system which must be used only for that
as much as possible.
