# Walking Alone

I don't know when I  
started walking alone.  
I just know, I have  
been doing it for a  
long time since then.

Walking alone... in many   
places and stages of life.  
And each time, it has   
been a different   
experience for me.  

When I walk alone,  
I always feel boring.  
Usual, isn't it?  
Consequently, I do some cool  
things to kill boredom.  
Actually, only two. :P  
One is, I look at my watch.  
The other is, I look at  
people and surroundings.  

Looking at my watch,  
just means looking.  
I don't even look  
at the time it shows.  
I just "look" at it.  
You have no idea.  
I look at it for  
about 5 times in  
a minute or two, sometimes.  
And when I am fed up  
I look at the time it shows.  
And this continues.  

Same thing when it comes  
to people and surroundings.  
Most times, I just "look"   
and not observe.  

Then how can I have a different   
experience each time?   
You will get to know.  

I wake up in the morning.   
I get ready for college  
and walk to the bus stop  
to board the college bus.  

Walking alone, I  
look at newspaper boys,  
milk vendors and vehicles.  
And I look at my watch.  
The minute and hour hands  
swirl really fast.  

And I find myself walking   
on a road in the college,  
leading to my first year block.  
I usually walk with my bus mates.  
But it's an unusual day.  
I walk alone...    
looking at people walking   
the same road   
and nearby roads.   
And I am actually walking fast.  
Really fast. Why?  
Well, I am walking alone.  
I am bored. So, I wanna  
reach my destination fast.  

And sometimes, walking fast,   
catches attention. And I   
feel really awkward,  
like, damn awkward, when   
people are staring at me.  
After a fast walk, I reach   
my block. I climb the stairs,  
like a monkey and enter my class,  
smiling at people, shaking   
my head and waving hands.  
I sit at my place, look   
at the time in my watch.   
The hands in it  
swirl really fast.   

I find myself roaming around  
the college, with classmates.  
I walk alone even when they walk  
with me. Well. I can't help it.  
I am considered boring and dumb.  

Though I feel bad, I do understand it.   
It's because even I have ignored  
people who look boring to me.  
And I have felt bad about that  
too. I am trying to change.  

And while walking, I pass  
by girls, actually, famous girls.  
College guys make them famous.   
And these girls, just go above  
limits consequently. I don't know   
why, but I just feel dumb if I  
look at them. I feel   
"Are they the only girls? :P"  
and I just look away and pass by,  
unlike my classmates who get   
hyper active and crazy,  
and they call me dumb for this also.  
I look at my watch,  
the surroundings move backwards  
and everything changes.  

I find myself sitting alone  
in a two seater seat, in   
the college bus, returning home.  
I am looking at the happenings  
outside, as the bus moves.  
I keep looking at the same   
direction, with my eyes still,  
almost staring, as the things   
around move backwards  
and let my thoughts flow.  
The bus stops in traffic.  
And I am staring at a place  
on the road, a girl walks  
that way and stops by,  
to cross the road.  
After a few seconds I   
realize I have been staring  
at a girl's face and that   
she is doing the same to me  
and feeling awkward   
and blushing, I look away.  
And I say to myself  
"You are dumb! :P *facepalm*"  
I look at the time,  
the bus and everything   
moves backward and disappears.  

I find myself walking alone,  
to my house, from the bus stop.  
It's evening time. And very  
less people are walking   
on the road. And my city,  
is a very insecure one.  

There's this girl, who   
kept walking in front of  
me and was going in the   
same path, that I use to go home.  
And she keeps turning back  
and stares at me few times.  
And that too, I was walking   
fast as usual and I was trying   
to slow down. But couldn't.  
Feeling upset about how she  
thought about me, and feeling   
bad about the city's state of   
security, I take a different path,   
slightly longer one to reach   
my home, just not to make her   
feel uncomfortable.  

After that, whenever I saw some  
lady walk in front of me,  
either I used to take a   
different path, or just cross   
the road and walk fast, past  
them. Just to make them believe  
I wasn't following them. Even then,   
there was a time when a lady almost   
stopped by for a second when I walked   
past her across a quite thin road.  
Feeling really bad, I see my watch,  
things go backwards and everything  
disappears.  

I find myself sitting at home, and   
thinking about all the crazy and weird   
things that I have done, while walking   
and being alone. And feel bad about walking  
alone even now. And I write about it.   
I look at the clock, everything moves   
backward and disappears.  

And I find myself in my bed,  
setting the alarm for the next day,  
hoping to have a nice sleep.
