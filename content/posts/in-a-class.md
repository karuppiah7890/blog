> This is a story by me :)

We are in a grade 10 class in AllCool School. Students are studying chemistry and their professor has asked them to solve a problem

Aman has finished the problem and he is acting as though he's not done and is pretending he's thinking about the problem and is looking around to pretend he wants help. While looking around he is thinking "Damn, I wish I could keep looking at Rahul. I have to do so much pretending and look around and just get a small glimpse of him each time. And he looks stunning with his new hair style. And he smells so good! I wonder what perfume he uses. I should ask him that and start a conversation! But that's gonna be weird. May be I'll just ask him about some math problem. And sneak in that question!"

Professor Leela shouts "Aman! What are you dreaming about? And why are you looking around? Not able to find the answer to the problem? Trying to copy from someone else?"

Aman says "umm, mam, I was just thinking about another problem that I was solving yesterday and how it is similar to this one you just gave. I have solved this one"

Leela is surprised and a bit embarrassed for judging. And asks him to bring his notebook and she checks it. Aman thinks "haha. Classic Leela mam. Got fooled. And this is better than me getting embarrassed getting caught for staring at Rahul. Also this is fun. Leela mam getting embarrassed, haha". Leela appreciates Aman after finding out that the answer to the problem is perfect and then asks him to be seated and quiet, so that the answer to the problem is not revealed. She asks others in the class if they have solved it and that it's almost time for the next class to start.
