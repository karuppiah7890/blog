Recently I was lurking on the Internet. I stumbled upon this user
profile on GitHub

https://github.com/GOVINDDIXIT

[Govind](https://github.com/GOVINDDIXIT)'s profile looked so cool!
Below is a screenshot of the same

That's just a part of it! There was a lot of information in the profile.
After seeing this, I was searching on the Internet to find some docs on
how to do this. Weirdly I couldn't find any official GitHub docs on how
to add readme to a user profile. I got to know it's a readme because I
could see it on the top of the profile information

I finally realized I could click on the top left on this readme,
at the username, which was a link that lead me to the repo containing
this readme. I was initially looking for this readme related stuff
in my GitHub user settings ðŸ˜… only to realize the information lies
in a repo.

Anyways, I realized that this repo was named with the user's
username. It was a bit unique

https://github.com/GOVINDDIXIT/GOVINDDIXIT

I also read through the source code (raw version) of the readme
markdown in this repo over
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GOVINDDIXIT/GOVINDDIXIT/master/README.md).
I found out how those fancy things on the readme show up :)
Especially the `GitHub Stats`.

I did this because, weirdly, clicking on the stats image on the readme preview,
lead to some [different link](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4327ba150b74ae48ce926fee95968b0efeed725b/68747470733a2f2f6769746875622d726561646d652d73746174732e76657263656c2e6170702f6170693f757365726e616d653d474f56494e4444495849542673686f775f69636f6e733d7472756526686964655f626f726465723d74727565).
I think it's GitHub's link for image resources. Later I found out that it was
infact working with the below
[link](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=GOVINDDIXIT&show_icons=true&hide_border=true) 
when I checked the readme source code

```
https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=GOVINDDIXIT&show_icons=true&hide_border=true
```

I changed some of those query parameter values to see how it worked,
and then just changed username field to my username `karuppiah7890`

```
https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=karuppiah7890&show_icons=true&hide_border=true
```

Since it was good enough, I didn't dig more into it, to
see other options or how it worked etc ðŸ˜…

So I went on to create my own readme at

https://github.com/karuppiah7890/karuppiah7890

This is how it will look when you create the repo

![New Repo Page](/blog/img/github-profile-readme/new-repo-page.png "New Repo Page")

Since I already created the repo and then took the
screenshot, it shows a warning that I already have the
repo ðŸ˜‚ Anyways, you can see how GitHub says it's a secret
and that you found it. It also tells you that it's a special
repo :D

I guess this is GitHub way of hiding easter eggs in it's
platform ;)

Go ahead and create your readme for your profile! :D

About the GitHub stats, you can check out more over here
