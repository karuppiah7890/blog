Spring Boot (Spring?)

Initializer class with config? Needed? Not sure. How does initializer help?

[Check if Testcontainers can help with Spring too. I think it can!! It's
generic :) Not related to Spring. So yeah]

Run test containers easily across multiple test methods and even test files

Does this post specifically help with Testcontainers along with Spring Boot?
Or should I just leave it and put all the effort in the generic explanation in
my other blog post about "Testcontainers in Java for your tests"
