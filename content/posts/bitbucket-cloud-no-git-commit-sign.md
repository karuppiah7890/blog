Really? I understand it's a less used feature. I have not seen many
people talk about it or use it, but hey, it's an important security
feature - as anyone can masquerade as someone else! I mean, ideally
it won't happen, in a company or organization where everyone is
trusted. It's still a good thing. Also, if some open source community
is using it, it's still good. I don't know what's the deal, but BitBucket
Cloud doesn't support Git commit signing as of this writing

There's a recent comment over [here](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-discussions/How-do-I-add-a-GPG-key-to-my-Bitbucket-account/td-p/795058#M2448)
recommends people who are interested in the feature to vote in the JIRA card
of the feature

https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-3166?error=consent_required&error_description=Consent+required&state=5e7f3b55-c5ac-45bb-acbc-524e503fe3b1

It's cool that there's a feature to vote on cards in JIRA!

By the way, after someone pointed out, I found out that the issue has been created in
2011! And it has got very few votes! Like, only 292 votes at the time of this
writing :/

And here I was, checking all these below docs or articles

https://dev.to/shostarsson/how-to-use-pgp-to-sign-your-commits-on-github-gitlab-bitbucket-3dae

They were all referring to BitBucket server it seems. I don't know the difference.
Gotta check.

Anyways. Crazy stuff :/ I just have to wait
