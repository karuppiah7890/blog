When people are telling their thoughts, share screen and write them down

These are like notes / minutes of meeting, which are kind of like recording the
meeting but in text

It also helps with avoiding parallel conversations. When writing things down,
people tend to read it and try to understand that we are jumping to multiple
things.

If someone didn't follow something, they can read what's on the screen.

It also helps to record everything that people say. If it's not recorded, it's
a problem with the note taking which needs to be enhanced to capture all ideas.
Sometimes people have multiple people taking notes so that even if one misses
something, another person probably noted it. But always have one person sharing
the screen. This screen can bring focus, or can be a bit distractive too. It
really depends.
