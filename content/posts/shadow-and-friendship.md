> Found this on my Tumblr blog. Migrating it here

This is a poem that I wrote long long ago, as far as I remember. 
Probably during 12th Std or may be during 1st sem college.
My Google Drive details say I uploaded this poem in Dec 2013.
Now, I am posting it here. Thank God I got this :P

# Shadow and Friendship

My shadow has always been a good companion.
At times, I play with his wonderful hands, I use them to  
make shapes of sheep, butterflies, angry dogs and many  
more things, on walls, roads and even the smooth floor. 
When I do this, I feel the the happiness of a child,  
when it sees a shadow puppet show. 
He's very different from my other friends.  
He imitates me with ease. 
Sometimes he's taller than me,  
sometimes he's thinner than me, 
but he's always a part of me. 
I just feel bad about one thing. 
He stays with me when I am in the light, 
but disappears when I am in the dark. 
I don't blame him for this, because it is not he, 
who chooses to disappear in the dark, 
it is science which restricts him.  
His existence is based on me and light. 
So, I do understand his position. 
And he is still a good friend to me. 
But when it comes to other friends, 
I don't want them to be like him, 
that is, staying with me in the light and 
disappearing when I am in the dark, 
because they don't have any restrictions like him. 
And I don't mean he's better than my other friends. 
I have a unique place for him and my other friends too.  
Every friend is equal to me.
