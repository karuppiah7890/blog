Arvind is attending KubeCon for the first time. He's on his own.

Arvind: Wow, this is all so grand! Let's find a place to sit and
enjoy the day and find new friends maybe!

Arvind finds his place. He finds himself surrounded by a lot of people.

There's a constant buzz around him. People talking about life and work.

The Conference starts with the keynote and the talks follow.

After some talks, it's break time. Arvind is all by himself, getting
food. He's introverted and not sure how to start a conversation. But
he does want to network with people, as it started to feel very lonely
and boring. He then finally musters up some courage and overcomes the
social anxiety, and starts a conversation with two women who are
standing close by.

"Hi, I'm Arvind"

"Hi! I'm Veena"

"Hello, I'm Sarah"

Arvind: So, how's the conference going on for you folks?

Veena: Pretty good! It's good to see the community growing. I'm also
finding new friends! I just met Sarah!

Sarah: Yes! I'm also excited to meet new people. And I'm looking
forward to talk to all the speakers in person! At least most of
them if not all

Veena: Me too! What about you? What do you think about the conference?

Arvind: It's my first time here. I've just started talking to folks,
starting with you two. It looks pretty grand. It must have taken a
lot of work to organize this event.

Sarah: Tell me about it. I'm part of the organizing team, and it's a
lot of work. Not easy to organize an event for so many people and the
crowd is very very diverse in so many ways. Speaking of organizing,
I just recalled I gotta take care of a small thing. Excuse me, I gotta
go. Enjoy the day! Let's may be meet in the next break!

Veena: Sure!

Arvind: See you later!

Arvind: So, how do you use Kubernetes?

Veena: The usual story. We have microservices. Hundreds of them.
Initially we deployed each instance of a microservice to a VM. And had
HA proxy loadbalancers in VMs. That was a lot of VMs. Now it's all
pods, and the cost has reduced quite a lot. And we don't go and manually
restart services in VMs by sshing into the machines. Kubernetes just
restarts it automatically with liveness probe. We are also able to
scale easily now. Next we are planning to have automatic scaling
based on number of requests, which is in the works

Arvind: So, you are part of an infra team?

Veena: Yes. Our goal is to make it easy for developers to easily deploy
and manage their apps on any infrastructure.

Arvind: Nice

Veena: How do you use Kubernetes?

Arvind: I just joined an infra team, which has similar goals like
your team's. We are still in the middle of our migration to Kubernetes.
Some of them are still are VMs

Veena: Ah, okay

Arvind: Apart from that I have also been checking out how to contribute
to Open Source projects. Kubernetes project being on them. I have
started doing small PRs for documentation for Kubernetes

Veena: That's cool!

Arvind: Hehe. What do you think about Open Source? Do you contribute to it?

Veena: I think Open Source is the future. And yes, I contribute to it
sometimes. So, how did you get started contributing?

Arvind: I actually got inspired by this person on the Internet named
'i m not a bot'. More like a single word imnotabot and not a sentence.
They too tell the same thing, that Open Source is the future, in their
blog. I'm actually here to see their first talk. I will get to see them
in person. I have never seen them anywhere online. No pics anywhere
on their blog or twitter. Not even in KubeCon site, and even speaker
name on KubeCon site is imnotabot. They are very anonymous. Anyways,
may be I'll meet them and tell that they are one my inspirations

Veena: Oh. Looks like you really want to meet them

Arvind: Yes!

Veena: So, how do they inspire you?

Arvind: Well, when I was new to Open Source. I read their blog posts
about Open Source and got inspired by it. I learned how to contribute
to Open Source from it and started with that. Then I saw them
contributing to Kubernetes. And I was going to move to a team doing
Kubernetes. So I thought I could check it out and contribute. So I
started following them on GitHub and started checking all their
contributions. Now I'm learning from their Pull Requests, while raising
documentation Pull Requests and checking out issues

Veena: Wow, you seem pretty inspired!

Arvind: Haha, yeah

Veena: Okay, I gotta go now and take care of something. May be meet you
later?

Arvind: Sure. And do checkout imnotabot's talk if you are around. It will
start after the break

Veena: Sure thing! See ya!

The break is over. MC comes to stage

MC: How's your energy after the break y'all? Can you show it to me
with a loud roar? yes? Rooooooar!

Crowd: ruuuur.

MC: Rur? And that too so low noise? Come on y'all, I expect it to be
more! I thought food gives you energy, come on!

Crowd: Rooooooarrrrr!

MC: That's what I'm talking about! Now, next up is our mysterious
speaker. They asked to put their name in the site and schedule as
imnotabot. They like to keep it anonymous and interesting. They are
also famous in the community, known by the same name. They are here
to tell their journey about how they migrated from one cloud
service provider to another. Let's welome Veena, also known as
imnotabot, with big round of applause!

Arvind: What? Veena? Woah.

Veena gets on stage. And the talk starts

"Hello folks! I'm Veena, and I'm going to share a journey with you."

The talk goes on and Arvind is dumbstruck, and listening to the awesome
talk.

The talk finishes. Arvind finally gets to meet Veena again

Arvind: Hey! That was a great talk! Why didn't you say anything before?

Veena: Well, I like giving surprises. And I like to be anonymous,
remember?

Arvind: Of course! Autograh please? Picture?

Veena: Seriously? Haha. Autograh may be. No pictures. You know right.
