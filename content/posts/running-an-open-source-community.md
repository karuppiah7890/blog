Keep talking about it

Don't just talk, do stuff too

Share knowledge! Share things that you have contributed to

Pair with newbies. Help them contribute. Give them an overview

Talk personally to people

Try to go for organic growth. Don't push or police around

Inspire people by actions. Show the benefits of doing open source!
Show why you do open source

Organizer should always be doing open source stuff so that no matter what,
there are some people always present as seeds to bring things up and running

Mentor people. Have many faces for the community. This avoids the single point
of failure. Have as many leaders and mentors as possible. This also avoids
gate keeping. Try hard to not do gate keeping! It's the killer of ideas at times.
I have noticed myself sometimes try to kill experiments or ideas, and quietly
stop when I realize it. It's good to try out experiments - I feel almost
everything is an experiment. But it's good to know why one experiment succeeded
but another failed. Know your successes and it's factors! It'll help you, or
else it might look like a fluke and you will feel bad - mostly because you didn't
analyze the success. Sometimes it might be hard to analyze, if there's not
enough information or no control or access to the people or information. It's
just that you have to now recreate the success by just thinking and doing things.

Cultivation is key, so keep mentoring people, encouraging them, helping them,
sometimes even pushing them to do things that they might not be comfortable
doing or be not confident about - just encourage and push. I'm really bad at
pushing - I usually tend to not push as I wouldn't like it being done to me, so
I treat people similar to how I would like to be treated, but apparently, some
people when pushed - learn and grow! Some might come out frustrated yes, but if
they learned stuff - they might understand later that it was probably worth it.

Also, when you mentor more people, there's more people to keep the community
up and running - try to create leaders. I think it's important for leaders and
mentors to create leaders and mentors. There's only so much that a single
person can do, but when many people get together and work as a team, a lot can
be achieved when the team has definitive goals :) And when I say leaders should
create leaders - they should let the new leaders lead too, that's why you created
them - trust them, let them lead. If they make mistakes, they will learn. If you
can help them in their journey, do help. Provide feedback, mentor them and help.

In terms of running events - always have a plan. I'm a man of plan. But hey,
plan is not enough. Execution is the most important thing. I'm bad at execution.
I think if you split the work among many people and do the work, execution
should be easy peasy. Just plan it all, get everyone on the same page. Let
everyone contribute and help. Don't be the lone wolf to try and do things - it
maybe possible - but it's going to wear you down and the process will be slow
too. You are not alone, get help, ask for help, call out if you can't do
something. I'm very bad at this. I think I'll learn more soon!
