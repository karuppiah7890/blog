Recently, when I was online on LinkedIn, I noticed this simple post which said
something along the lines of "In a world of Byjus and White Hat Jr, be someone's
Khan Academy and Code.org"

I think people within India might be able to relate to some parts of it. The
post is related to paid coding courses. You must have seen the tons of comments
on the post - many criticizing the companies behind these paid coding courses.

In this post, I want to talk about how education has become valuable and how
paid education is on the rise like crazy - many know this I guess? I just want
to touch upon it and also touch upon the free education available for many.

Let's get started with the above references - `Byjus` is an online app, which is
very famous in India. It's for school kids to learn online. It's paid tution
over the Internet. They boast over their really cool materials which are easy to
learn from for kids. Materials which are top notch.

`White Hat Jr` is another paid online education for coding for kids.

You should see the ads for these apps in India. They are so slick and just can
pull anyone in. I guess any modern day advertisement is good now.

Let's take a different path now, the above are online education / E education.
And are more related to just teaching, without any certificates etc. They are
more like teaching to augment the education in school or to enable the kid in
school. What about actual brick and mortar schools? Given it's corona time,
many schools have gone electronic too, and are trying out E education. You
should hear about the cost of schooling in India - the medium to elite ones are
all really really costly. The same goes for even college education in India.
I think it's a similar case in a few other countries too. And I'm specifically
referring to the private schools and colleges in India. Not the government
based / funded ones. Private education is so costly in India, my country.
I just can't imagine why they ask for so much money for my nephew who is just
five years old. And there's also bribing to even register and admit the kid into
the school. Can you imagine how much bribe money goes into it? Almost everyone
pays the bribe. Almost everyone. Only the ones who opt for government based /
funded schools and colleges usually won't have to go through that hassle. And
very few private colleges, like mine, don't take bribe or any extra money than
what the university law mentions as the tution fees.

So that's the state of private education in India. Not everyone can get into the
government schools and colleges, so some just have to go to private. Imagine
this - education is the most important thing, and to attain education and a
good one that too, you need to pay so much?! What will middle class and low
income families do? I know how much looting there is when it comes to other
country colleges even in public colleges. I have no idea how that price is worth
it, and I can't even imagine for private colleges. And I keep hearing about the
sad stories of student loans in countries. I studied college with the help of an
education loan, but that's way too low compared to the loans taken by the
students in other countries.

You can also see how many students are looking to borrow in https://www.kiva.org/ website. They are looking for loans to pay back after their education!
That is, when they get a job. You should see the period of their loans on Kiva
website - 30 months, 60 months! And this is just a simple website which loans
money to people and there's no too much problems really. But when you get loans
from banks and other financial institutions, the loan period is crazy and the
interest rates are just unbelievable!!

So we are basically making it harder and harder for people to study - by almost
making education an elite thing - that only people with money can do. I think
education is the only basic thing can bridge the gap between very very low
income class and the middle class. Education is the only thing can increase
someone's affordability, better someone's life style, make someone's life
better. Education in any form can help actually. Or else rich will just get
richer and poor will just keep getting poorer I think. Literacy rates, access to
education, all have to increase and get better.

Now, back to the first thing we spoke about - Byjus, White Hat Jr. They are paid
services, yes. I'm not going to say they are bad. I have no idea about them -
I have never used them. But I can say this - they are the services that are
making sure that education is paid, and showing that quality education can only
be paid. I agree that everyone needs money and that everything can't be free,
but if education isn't free, many things are going to go wrong. I completely
support Khan Academy, Freecodecamp and other free services that teach for free.

On a final note, I want to mention one more thing. I'm always in a dilemma
about the reasoning for paid content when I think about paid content like books
and videos and what not - sometimes I feel like the creators of the content
need to have a living so have to get paid, and then I feel it's fair. But then
again, I just feel that the number of copies that get sold and the amount for
each copy, it's all a bit much? I don't know. One might say that the creators
are very reasonable and that the costs are good and value for money - maybe
true, may not be. But I know one thing - free content is not so bad. Maybe it
might take more time for the free education on the Internet to get better. It
might be time consuming to learn - but I think people who don't have money, they
have time to some extent at least, to slowly learn. Unlike professionals, who
get paid for work, and can pay for courses and books and learn things faster -
but I still can't say that that's the best way of learning because I know for
sure that everyone learns differently. For me, the take away is - if I ever
create content, I'll make sure that it's free. I hope that it remains that way
as always. Also, however I don't think anyone will pay for my content if I make
it paid :P Not sure about it's value/worth. Also, I'm not famous and all, so I
don't know how people will even find my content :P If you are reading this, you
might be my only reader :P :)
