I had heard this term "Open Source Mindset" from a colleague when prepping for an event about Open
Source. I started to think "What does that mean? What does it to mean to me?".
I'm no pro. I'm just another software developer, always in awe looking at the
tons of new Open Source projects on the Internet. I have contributed very few
Pull Requests (Patches) to very few Open Source projects. But I was starting to think - is there anything special about me? If yes, what is it? Anything that I possibly do differently when it comes to Open
Source? Probably something similar to many other people contributing to Open
Source or using Open Source do?

I came to realize some of the things that I do when it comes to Open Source -

- Whenever I learn something, I always try to put it in my blog, or create a
  YouTube video out of it. Usually it's about something Open Source as most of
  the softwares I use are Open Source.
- Whenever I use a software, I usually check if it's Open Source. Surprisingly,
  a lot of the software we use are Open Source or have lots of parts of it Open
  Sourced or at least has some small Open Source projects used by the software's
  company
- Whenever I find an issue in an Open Source software, I look for solutions and
  sometimes even report if no one has reported about the problem. I have done
  this only a few times though - mostly because someone had already reported and
  I just had to fix my issue, or the issue was mostly because of a mistake I
  made
- I try to talk about Open Source as much as possible, whenever and wherever it
  makes sense / fits

I also think that the Open Source mindset is a subset of the Open Knowledge
mindset - where everyone tries to share their knowledge with others as much
as possible - like being an Open Book, keeping the knowledge Open to everyone
with no discrimination. In the eyes of Knowledge, everyone is equal.
