Operating in a Team - no policing, no burdening people, self signups. Take
responsibility as a team. Sometimes team leads may be blamed. When blamed, just
chuck it. It can be annoying to agree when everyone is responsible. But to be a
leader - I think it's key to just take what people say and move on and do what
your gut tells. Everyone has opinions.
