Testcontainers is a library that helps you run Docker containers. There's a Java
library and there are libraries in other languages too.

I'm not sure about the support for other container runtimes. Do check it out.
I have noticed that Testcontainers Java site mentions only about Docker
container runtime. I'm going to focus only on Docker container runtime in this
post :)

[Check GitHub issues about support for other container runtimes]

Open Source library

Easy to use

Easily integrates with your code and tests

Has integration for Junit 5

[Check if Junit 4 is supported]

Talk about different kinds of containers and also about the ability to create
your own Containers using GenericContainer class

Show examples with Postgres Container and Generic Container

Show examples with Extensions Concept and also with inheritance maybe? Talk
about pros and cons after checking about it! :)
