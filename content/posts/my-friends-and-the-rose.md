I was walking with my friends on the road. Suddenly I smelled a rose from the
other side of the river. I didn't inform my friends and sneaked out and left
them to go in the opposite side towards the river. 

The water was flowing happily fast. It was so hard for me to cross the river,
but I crossed it. I ran towards the smell of the rose. I could finally see it
from far away with lot of thorns around it. I crossed all the thorns without
a scratch on me and picked up the rose. The stem of the rose hurt my fingers
though, because of the sharp thorns on it.

I was happy. I turned around to go home, only to notice my friends standing
there. Their clothes all wet and torn. Some of them even bleeding a bit. 
No words were spoken. I was not sure if I was still happy. I left the rose
where it was and hugged my friends and went back home with them.
