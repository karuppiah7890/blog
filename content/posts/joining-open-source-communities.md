I'm always lurking the Internet endlessly ðŸ˜… I'm working on lessening
it. Keeping that aside, I lurk a lot, especially in Twitter and
then from there, I click links to many other sites, and sometimes go
deeper and deeper following links and getting lost. But that's only
sometimes ðŸ˜… Usually I'm just scrolling Twitter a lot. While doing this,
I see a lot about the cool software that people are creating and follow
them to see what new they are doing. I have noticed a lot of softwares
like that. Something new, cool and created by famous people, or they
got famous because of the new cool shiny thing and I see how it's
gaining some traction. Whenever I see them, I get FOMO (Fear Of Missing
Out). Sometimes I just ignore it. But most times, when it relates to
infra, the field that my job is entirely dependent on, I just find it
hard to ignore. And then I'm like "I should try this out. And it's open
source! I should contribute to it! It's so cool! I can't imagine how
cool it would feel contributing to it!"

Below is the list some of the softwares that I have had my eyes on and
are big buzz words or are actually cool (I don't know which of it they
are). They are open source projects and I want(ed?) to contribute to them

[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes),
[Docker](https://github.com/moby/moby),
[Consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul),
[Nomad](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad),
[Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform),
[Dapr](https://github.com/dapr),
[micro](https://github.com/micro),
[openfaas](https://github.com/openfaas),
[firecracker-microvm](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm)

So, what's the first thing you do to contribute? These days, I usually
first try out the software. Just try it out. Not much thinking, just
make it work. See what it does for the end users. No checking on how
or what or whatever, unless it's needed to make it work, which usually
isn't the case

I have tried out the basics of some of the softwares I mentioned above.
The next thing I do is check out the issues. Sometimes I checkout
issues even before trying out the software. Just to see how many issues
they got and what kind etc and if I can even understand the title of
the issue and understand the details that the OP has provided. In any
case I usually end up in the GitHub issues page. And then what I do,
is just go with the flow and find issues to work on. Till now, I have
only worked on a very few projects. So I can say how that went. So, I
usually pick one issue, start analysing the issue, sometimes comment on
it - asking for more info, telling the findings and what are the weird
things that I notice. Sometimes even raise a PR.

What just happened above is - I joined an open source community. I'm
interacting with the community through comments on GitHub issues. This
happened a lot when I was contributing to
[Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) project. And then I started
checking out the other communities outside of GitHub, I had already
seen some of them, like Gitter chats, Slack channels, Discourse forums,
Discord to name a few. I can't remember anything else. The thing is,
I had used these very less when it comes to open source. I tried
Gitter when I was in the [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
community. It was a lot of messages in the rooms. I got overwhelmed
and left at some point. And I had tried others too. Same thing with
Discord, and for Discourse it was just a lot of emails and a lot of
content. I was not even checking any of these. So, it was pointless
to be using. I was like "Do I even want to be there? Does it spark
joy?" And then there's Slack. A lot of them have Slack, but even
that - it's a lot of messages. I even hate my work Slack. And work
and personal emails. It's just too much info, everywhere. I just get
overwhelmed by just seeing the sheer number that they show.
"100 messages unread", "30 emails in Inbox".

But recently I have been taking control and seeing how to reduce the
amount of things I check and trying to check only things that make
sense to me, or immediately ignore, for my own good.

I have been doing that in Slack and emails, in all - personal, work,
and open source. 

I'm part of the Slack org (organization) for multiple open source projects.
Just like that. I just joined them when I read about em and found they
have a Slack org. I think there's an overwhelming amount of Slack orgs
that I have joined! Currently, I have logged out of all, and just
logged into a few. I want to share some of these Slack stories and
also some stories on GitHub, with respect to joining a community

Before sharing some of these stories, other than these online
communities, there are also actual communities, who get together in
person and talk and do stuff together. I haven't been to such
communities much. Some examples of these are - meetups, conferences,
just any kind of events where people come together for a thing
and are physcially present. I have been to just one or two meetups, and
no public conferences. So my stories about communities are just
confined to GitHub and Slack!

Let me start with the most recent story. I recently joined openfaas and
firecracker-mircrovm slack community and was checking out their github
repos. Joining firecracker-microvm slack was pretty easy! I just clicked
[a link](https://join.slack.com/t/firecracker-microvm/shared_invite/enQtNDY2NTUwMzQ3MDE1LWIwMzA0OWFkMTZhMTlmMDZiMmFkYjMyODMxMGQ1ZjliMzJjNjJiNWRhNWNkOGEyNmUxNmRkMjZhYTc3MmVjZjM)
in their [readme](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker#faq--contact)
and put some details and I was able to join their slack community.
Pretty easy right? Most slack communities that I know do it this way.
They just provide one link which is
