title: "My Cheatsheet for Commands and Stuff"

Recently I have been noting down the commands I use :P I think it's especially
useful for commands that take quite some time for me to get right and I'm
always searching the Internet or the command manuals or help text for the same
thing again and again each time. And the search sometimes takes time - almost
the same amount of time that took for me during the first time. So, I thought -
why not just use my own reference? My own cheatsheet?

So I created this repo called cheatsheets - https://github.com/karuppiah7890/cheatsheets/ .
I think this is a great start. I'm going to check all the commands I use slowly,
and write them down here, based on the command name.

Currently I have `gcloud`, `kubectl`, `jq` and some more in my list. I haven't
written down the commands that I use for all of them. That's gonna take some,
there are quite a lot of commands. To start with, I'm just noting down the kind
of commands that I use and their use case or what they do - based on which I
form a question - like someone asking "how do I login?" and then I answer it
with some text and commands. Next time I can't remember how to do something, I
could easily find from my cheatsheet instead of searching through my command
history or checking the Internet or help text or manual from scratch. I have
also seen a good alternative for this if the command is very very frequently
used - you can save these commands with description and then use them very
easily whenever you need it. Check this software called [`pet`](https://github.com/knqyf263/pet),
I haven't tried it out myself, but I guess I'll soon. It looks promising!

Other than that, I guess if someone asks me about some command, I'll just note
it down here - it will be useful for others too, apart from me ;)
