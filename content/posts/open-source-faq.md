Open Source? What? Why? How?

What? Free as in Libre - Freedom.

Why? Has lot of benefits. For me, it's giving back to the community from which
I take a lot.
Benefits

- Lot of people contribute (this is not easy though. some contributions may
  lack perfection - have to help community to contribute)
- Lots of people use the software and give feedback for making it better and
  also report bugs

How? Companies, Individuals, Donations, free time work / side projects.

Open Source business models - Open Core model with Paid edition, Paid support,
Paid tutorials (books, courses etc), Paid Hosting of Service (SaaS etc) whose
source code is Open

Examples of OSS backed by companies

- MongoDB
- Elastic
- Hashicorp
- GitLab
- SideKiq

and many more!

More on how. Different Open Source softwares thrive differently. For example,
if a company contributes to a famous Open Source software, they can take pride
in saying that "we are one of the creators/contributors of the software" and
can provide paid support and help and hosting for that software. More like a
service - a paid service, purely based on knowledge, experience and credibility
and not based on software - which is probably free and Open Source.

Licenses?

Open Source Lawyers!

Open Source is not confined to just Software. Open Source Hardware - open
blueprints etc, Open Source Art etc. I believe in Open Education, Open
Knowledge, which are terms I just coined. Not sure if such a term really exists.
Gotta check! :P Open Education, Open Knowledge are more generic umbrella with
all these other stuff under it. Open Access to Knowledge is what I stand for! :)
